The mechanism responsible for the pathogenesis is complex and the predisposition to thrombus formation in pregnancy is probably the interaction of several different factors. Because of the risks of anticoagulant therapy, it is important to establish the diagnosis of thromboembolism before commencing treatment using venography and pulmonary angiography when necessary. When anticoagulants are used in pregnancy, coumarin derivatives can be used until 36 weeks and then substituted by heparin; alternatively heparin alone can be given throughout pregnancy. Subcutaneous heparin has no fetal effects and can be used successfully on an outpatient basis. Prevention is always better than cure, and it is essential that well-established preventive measures should be carried out diligently so that the incidence of this rare, but dreaded, complication can be reduced to an absolute minimum.', 'Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnancy. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are relatively frequent occurrences in pregnancy and the postpartum period.

When TFH cells encounter an activating peptide presented by B cells, the TFH cells respond by expressing receptors and cytokines that in turn activate B cells. As mentioned above, the induced expression of CD40L on TFH cells activates CD40 on B cells to increase B-cell survival, and also induces B-cell expression of co-stimulatory molecules, especially those of the B7 family. Activated T cells also express CD30 ligand (CD30L), which binds to CD30 expressed on B cells and promotes B-cell activation. Mice lacking CD30 show reduced proliferation of activated B cells in lymphoid follicles and weaker secondary humoral responses than normal. TFH cells also secrete several cytokines that regulate B-cell proliferation and antibody production. Primary among these is IL-21, which is produced early in immune responses by TFH cells and which activates the transcription factor STAT3 in B cells to support proliferation and differentiation. IL-21 exerts similar autocrine effects on TFH cells. Later', 'Cell interaction molecules and cytokines which participate in B lymphopoiesis. A molecular and cellular definition of the bone marrow microenvironment is rapidly contributing to our understanding of lymphohaemopoiesis. While lineage specific genes and their protein products are being identified, information is accumulating about mechanisms which may regulate their expression. Stimulation of B lymphocyte precursor replication, and other discrete functions, are being attributed to cytokines such as interleukin 7 (IL-7). The activity of these factors may be controlled at the level of synthesis, local concentration and interaction with extracellular matrix. Extremely small amounts of IL-7 are made by stromal cells, which are themselves being thoroughly studied as cloned cell lines. This in vitro characterization suggests that stromal cells can make at least 12 cytokines, that they can respond to some of those cytokines themselves, and that they retain differentiation potential. Several molecules have been identified which are probably required for recognition between cells in marrow. It is noteworthy that they belong to several previously described families of adhesion molecules and none is unique to that tissue. VCAM-1 is constitutively expressed on stromal cells in marrow and can be recognized by pre-B cells which bear the integrin VLA-4. The same pair of molecules is probably responsible for extravasation of leukocytes in other tissues during inflammation. Cell adhesion molecules are likely to work in a carefully coordinated and cooperative fashion. Their activity can be controlled by expression or, in some cases, modulated after display on the cell surface. For example, while most haemopoietic cells bear CD44, only certain cells utilize it for recognition of the ligand hyaluronate. The affinity for hyaluronate can be experimentally regulated and depends on the cytoplasmic domain of CD44. This capability for dynamic change may be important for transient interactions between cells, permitting movement of maturing precursors within and from marrow.']\n",

The problem represented by healthy carriers as infection risks is currently under study.', 'InternalMed_Harrison. HBsAg-positive serum containing HBeAg is more likely to be highly infectious and to be associated with the presence of hepatitis B virions (and detectable HBV DNA, see below) than HBeAg-negative or anti-HBe-positive serum.

In acute spinal cord diseases with involvement of corticospinal tracts, the paralysis or weakness affects all muscles below a given level; if the white matter is extensively damaged, sensory loss below a circumferential level on the trunk is conjoined (loss of pain and temperature sense because of spinothalamic tract damage, and loss of vibratory and position sense from posterior column involvement).

These abnormalities may be the result of an intrinsic lesion of the cord or an extrinsic mass that narrows the spinal canal and compresses the cord.', 'InternalMed_Harrison.

In cases where there significant anterolisthesis (subaxial cervical jumped or perched facets), reduction of the fracture may be important for both decompression and stabili-zation. However, in some cases, reduction of the fracture may not be sufficient for decompression, and further decompressive surgery may still be needed.50Several controversial topics require consideration here. First, the timing of surgery has been a controversial topic. In the past, it has been suggested that patients with incomplete injury, or a deteriorating exam warrant emergent decompres-sion, whereas patients with complete injuries can undergo sur-gery in a nonemergent manner. It is important to appreciate the risks of taking a medically unstable patient to surgery, such as a polytrauma patient with hemorrhagic shock or a complete spinal cord injury patient in neurogenic shock. However, there are clear benefits to early surgical', 'Suggested MRI criteria for surgical decompression in acute spinal cord injury. Preliminary observations. The effect of spinal cord compression identified with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), on neurological prognosis, was retrospectively evaluated in 36 patients with acute spinal cord injury. Of the 21 patients without cord compression, 16 had potentially reversible injury (normal spinal cord or cord oedema), all having functional recovery. Of the 15 patients with cord compression, 3 had operative decompression. In the 12 patients who did not undergo surgery, the degree of recovery was directly related to the magnitude of spinal cord compression, only one of the patients with moderate or marked cord compression having useful motor function at follow up. In contrast, the 3 patients with surgical decompression had at least 2 grades of improvement, all having functional recovery. These findings raise the possibility that MRI may be used to identify a patient group who will benefit from surgical decompression.

Sporadic cases are seen and it occurs in familial groups, with autosomal dominant inheritance, when it is associated with phaeochromocytoma and parathyroid hyperplasia to form the second type of multiple endocrine adenomatosis (MEA2).

It became evident that the virus infection per se is not sufficient and that additional events modifying the host cell genome contribute to the development of virus-linked human cancers.

When the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 created a new agency in the U.S. Public Health Service to foster the development of practice guidelines and outcomes and effectiveness research, the Institute of Medicine was engaged to develop the criteria for guideline development and medical review. The new agency--the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR)--has used those criteria to develop and disseminate its first three commissioned guidelines, released this spring. Those criteria are elaborated in the IOM\\'s 1990 book. In a second book, released this summer, the IOM Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines reviews the constructive expectations for guidelines and the conditions needed to ensure rigor in their development, application, evaluation, and revision to help realize these expectations. Key recommendations for action are development of an instrument to assess guidelines and establishment of an organization to carry out the assessment of guidelines. In an appendix, the report offers \\\\\"A Provisional Instrument for Assessing Clinical Practice Guidelines.\\\\\" While asking that organizations undertake more field testing and revision of the instrument, the Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines believes that the provisional instrument will be useful as an educational tool for those beginning to develop guidelines, a self-assessment tool that developers of guidelines can use to check their work, and a tool for external groups to use in judging whether a set of guidelines should or should not be recommended or adopted.', 'Proposal for establishing structure and process in the development of implicit chiropractic standards of care and practice guidelines.

Wild-type and mutant human transferrin receptors (TR) have been expressed in chicken embryo fibroblasts using a helper-independent retroviral vector. By functional studies of the mutant TRs, we have identified the tetrapeptide sequence, YXRF, in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor as the internalization signal required for high efficiency endocytosis and shown that transplanted internalization signals from the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (Man-6-PR) are able to promote rapid internalization of the human TR. A six-residue LDLR signal, FDNPVY, is required for activity in TR, whereas a four-residue Man-6-PR signal, YSKV, is sufficient. These data indicate that internalization signals are interchangeable self-determined structural motifs and that signals from type I membrane proteins are active in a type II receptor. Putative internalization signals in the cytoplasmic tails of other receptors and membrane proteins can be identified based on the sequence patterns of the LDLR, Man-6-PR, and TR signals. Two such putative four-residue internalization signals, one from the poly-Ig receptor and one from the asialoglycoprotein receptor, were tested for activity by transplantation into TR and were found to promote high efficiency internalization.

      "retrieved contexts: [\"Obesity: an inherited metabolic deficiency in the control of macronutrient balance? It has generally been assumed that the body is 'energy blind' and calories from all three macronutrients contribute with the same value to energy balance. There is, however, accumulating evidence to suggest that during ad-libitum conditions energy balance is achieved by a separate regulation of carbohydrate, fat and protein balances. Regulation of carbohydrate balance has the highest priority in the hierarchy, which is appropriate because the limited glycogen stores are only capable of covering the carbohydrate oxidation for a few days. Due to the higher satiating power of carbohydrate and protein compared with fat, a reduction in the dietary fat/carbohydrate ratio produces a negative fat balance in normal subjects consuming the diet ad libitum, while an increase in dietary fat/carbohydrate ratio results in a positive fat balance and weight gain. Subjects with a genetically determined predisposition to obesity become obese when they are exposed to a particular range of environmental conditions. The available knowledge suggests that the genetic propensity to weight gain is caused by a susceptibility to dietary fat due to an impaired capacity to increase their lipid/carbohydrate oxidation when fed a high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet. This in turn promotes lipid storage, depletion of carbohydrate stores and increases appetite. By enlarging the fat stores, the accompanying insulin resistance and higher levels of circulating non-esterified fatty acids increase lipid oxidation until it is commensurate with the dietary fat intake. The development of obesity may therefore be viewed as a regulatory mechanism by which the impaired lipid oxidation rate is raised to match a high fat intake. However, by decreasing the dietary ratio of fat to carbohydrate, macronutrient balance may be achieved with a high energy expenditure and a normal body composition. The results support current dietary recommendations, but with less emphasis on carbohydrate source, and they are also applicable for the prevention and treatment of obesity.\", 'InternalMed_Harrison. Whatever the role of genes, it is clear that the environment plays a key role in obesity, as evidenced by the fact that famine prevents obesity in even the most obesity-prone individual.

Undoubtedly, genes influence the susceptibility to obesity in response to specific diets and availability of nutrition.

The justification hypothesis postulates that an individual genetically deficient in the synthesis of any of the 12 nonessential amino acids requires that amino acid in the diet just as a normal individual requires any essential amino acid. The deficiency of that single amino acid causes diminished protein synthesis. The hypothesis proposes that mental retardation develops during the late stage of fetal development, when the brain is growing most rapidly, as a result of the inability of the mother to deliver an appropriate amount of that nonessential amino acid to her fetus who, in turn, is unable to correct for this deficiency due to his genetic constitution. A paradigm is provided by the disease phenylketonuria in which the homozygote lacks the enzyme for synthesis of the nonessential amino acid tyrosine. By measuring the appearance of tyrosine in the plasma after an oral dose of phenylalanine, it is possible to show differential capability among siblings of known phenylketonuric children, in the expected Mendelian ratio. The mean IQ of the two-thirds of the siblings who were least able to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine (presumably heterozygotes) was 10 points lower than the mean IQ of the \\\\\"normals,\\\\\" who were most able to synthesize tyrosine.

It results from reduced activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase. The accumulation of phenylalanine inhibits the transport of other amino acids required for protein or neurotransmitter synthesis, reduces synthesis and increases degradation of myelin, and leads to inadequate formation of norepinephrine and serotonin.

H. pylori infection is strongly associated with chronic gastritis and is probably the main course of chronic inflammation in the gastric mucosa. Acquisition of the infection will lead to gastritis and the eradication of the bacterium results in healing and final cure of the gastritis. Chronic gastritis and H. pylori infection may occur in antrum and/or corpus, and will gradually result in atrophy of the underlying mucosa in a great number of affected persons. Correspondingly, impairments in several important functions of the gastric mucosa are consequences of the atrophy and inflammation. Hp infection and gastritis associate with important gastroduodenal diseases, such as peptic ulcer diseases and gastric cancer. There are reasons to suggest that the infection and subsequent gastritis precede these diseases, and that they are important risk factors for both disorders. In fact, peptic ulcer can be seen a late frequent complication of an H. pylori infection. In addition, the type and grade of gastritis can be used in prediction of the ulcer risk if adequate biopsy specimens are available for microscopy from both antrum and corpus mucosa (Table II).

Although benign causes of syncope, such as reflex-mediated neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope and orthostatic hypotension, are generally more common, it is important to consider the possibility of heart disease or a genetic syndrome causing VT. When these are suspected, hospitalization for further evaluation and monitoring is often appropriate.']\n",

Relevance to the problem of antiglobulin induction in rheumatoid arthritis. Evidence is presented which indicates the presence on murine lymphocytes of a membrane receptor for determinants on the hinge region of human IgG. These determinants are exposed following pepsin scission of IgG molecule, i.e. on the F(ab')2 fragment. The evidence for a hinge receptor derives, in vivo, from splenic localization of F(ab')2 in germinal centres and, in vitro, from immunofluorescent binding studies. The sequential immunofluorescent pattern for the uptake of human F(ab)2 fragments into murine spleen germinal centres was identical with that previously observed for heat-aggregated human IgG, but F(ab')2 fragments appeared to be retained in the germinal centres for a shorter time than aggregated IgG. Experiments with nude mice and T cell-deprived mice showed that the localization of F(ab')2 fragments does not require T cells. Competition experiments suggest that the receptor for F(ab')2 may bear little relation to the receptor for aggregated IgG. The relevance of such a lymphocyte membrane receptor to the immunopathology of rheumatoid arthritis is discussed in the light of previous findings that a proportion of the serum IgG of patients with rheumatoid arthritis has a structural anomaly compared with control IgG, characterized exposure of new determinants at the hinge region.\", \"The binding constants of IgM rheumatoid factors and their univalent fragments for native and aggregated human IgG;.

A radioimmunoassay was developed for the determination of interaction of 19S IgM RF and Fabmicron RF with human 7S IgG, heat-aggregated IgG, rabbit 7S IgG, and human pFc'. RF isolated under neutral conditions had a very low binding constant for human 7S IgG (of the order of 10(2) to 10(3) 1 mole-1) and a considerably higher value (ca. 10(5)) for the aggregated protein and monomeric rabbit IgG. RF obtained under acid conditions which dissociate the complexes with endogenous Ig, had a higher avidity for human IgG monomer as expected and also a comparable reactivity with rabbit IgG. Monovalent Fabmicron fragments of 'acid' RF had closely similar affinities for 7S and aggregated IgG suggesting that the enhanced binding with the aggregated protein is essentially dependent on its multivalency rather than the exposure of a new determinant lacking in the native molecule.\"]\n",

The study covers 342 patients still alive one month after the acute attack of their first myocardial infarction. Daily determinations of creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) in serum were carried out during hospitalization, so that a maximum enzyme value could be obtained for each enzyme and patient. A follow-up examination was performed after an observation time ranging from 12 to 38 months. Having calculated the mean (x) of the maximum enzyme values, a parallel relationship was found between the maximum CPK, LDH and SGOT values and the long-term prognosis in myocardial infarction, inasmuch as patients with maximum enzyme values above or equal to the mean had a significantly higher 2-year mortality than patients with values below x. In order to detect any slight difference between the three enzymes with reference to the long-term prognosis, the material was divided into four groups: one with peak values less than x-x/2 (lowest), one with values from x-x/2 to x exclusive (next lowest), one with values from x to x+x/2 exclusive (next highest) and a group with peak elevations greater than or equal to x+x/2 (highest). A tendency to increasing mortality from the next lowest to the highest maximum enzyme values was found. On the other hand, patients with the lowest peak values had a tendency to higher mortality than patients in the next lowest group. This characteristic was observed with regard to both CPK and LDH and to some extent to SGOT.', 'Significance of serum enzyme changes after cardiac catheterization and selective coronary arteriography. The serum creatine kinase (CK), aspartate transaminase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LD) and alpha-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase (HBD) were determined before and 3, 6, 18, and 36 hours after cardiac catheterization and angiocardiography in 56 consecutive patients with ischaemic heart disease. Five of these patients whose serum enzyme levels were higher than normal before the procedure were excluded from the study. Forty-one of the remaining 51 patients had left ventriculography and also selective coronary arteriography. In these 41 patients (groups 1 and 2--see below), the mean serum CK levels increased after the procedure to exceed the upper limit of normal at every study interval. The mean serum AST, LD, and HBD levels generally remained within the normal range at all study intervals, though serum AST increased abnormally in 9 of the 41 patients (22%) and serum LD and HBD each increased above the normal limit in 2 of 41 patients (4.9%). In 24 patients (group 1) whose coronary arteriograms showed insignificant coronary narrowing (less than 75%) in any of the three major coronary arteries, the increase in serum CK was significantly higher than in 17 patients (group 2) with greater than 75% narrowings in at least one of the three major coronary arteries. However, the degree of serum CK elevation observed during the postangiographic period was much lower than that in another group of 30 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction. In 10 patients (group 3) who had the same procedure as groups 1 and 2 except without the selective coronary arteriography, the serum enzyme levels showed no noticeable increase after the procedure. The difference in postangiographic serum CK elevation between patients with and without selective coronary arteriography and the difference between group 1 (without significant coronory narrowing) and group 2 (with significant narrowing) strongly suggest that the raised serum CK levels represent some form of myocardial damage caused by the coronary arteriography, which, however, is different at least in degree from that of acute myocardial infarction.']\n",

FUNDAMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS: With increasing frequency, laparoscopic procedures are now replacing conventional cholecystectomy. Given the choice, patients with cholecystolithiasis almost always opt for the former procedure. Because the laparoscopic procedure offers considerable advantages as compared with open surgery, the increased risk of local complications associated with it tends to be ignored. For example, injuries to the biliary ducts are about ten times as common as in the case of conventional cholecystectomy. Injuries to the bowel, previously unknown, are increasingly being observed. Symptoms associated with undetected injuries usually do not occur until the patient has been discharged. Ambulatory aftercare is particularly important following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Complications need to be detected in good time in order to be able to institute appropriate counter-measures.', 'Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: operative technique. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the routine procedure for most patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. At our institution, a two-surgeon, four-cannula technique is used.

Adherence to standard operative principles and careful attention to details in the laparoscopic technique will routinely result in the safe completion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

It encompasses the respiratory discomfort experienced in many different diease states as well as the shortness of breath felt by a normal subject during or after strenuous exercise. Several parameters which have been shown to correlate with the onset or severity of dyspnea are described, including reduced vital capacity, the ratio of minute ventilation to vital capacity, reduced breathing reserve, the work of breathing, and the oxygen cost of breathing. Attempts at quantitation of dyspnea have usually consisted of measuring physiological parameters associated with the sensation, such as the \\\\\"dyspneic index\\\\\". The direct measurement of respiratory sensations using modern psycho-physical methods is at an early stage of development. Since the observation that the existence of dyspnea is often unrelated to any disturbance of arterial blood gas composition, it has been generally held that the mechanism of dyspnea is primarily neurophysiological. The neural pathways may conceptually be divided into those which transmit the \\\\\"dyspnea message\\\\\" from the respiratory apparatus to integrating centers in the brain, and those concerned with subsequently bringing the sensation to the level of consciousness. It seems likely that there is no single sensing mechanism and neural pathway which will be able to explain dyspnea in the diverse populations of patients and subjects who experience unpleasant respiratory sensations. Three theories concerning mechanisms of dyspnea are briefly described: \\\\\"length-tension inappropriateness\\\\\", vagal afferent activity especially from the J-receptors, and the recent concept of diaphragmatic fatigue.

      "reference_contexts:['InternalMed_Harrison. Current information suggests that altered neuronal firing patterns and motor complications relate to nonphysiologic levodopa replacement. Striatal dopamine levels are normally maintained at a relatively constant level. In PD, dopamine neurons degenerate and striatal dopamine is dependent on the peripheral availability of levodopa. Intermittent doses of short-acting levodopa result in fluctuating plasma levels because of variability in transit of the drug from the stomach to the duodenum where it is absorbed and the short half-life of the drug. This variability results in exposure of dopamine receptors to pathologically high and low concentrations of dopamine. It has been hypothesized that more continuous delivery of levodopa might prevent the development of motor complications. Indeed, a recent controlled study demonstrated that continuous intraintestinal infusion of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (Duodopa) is associated with significant improvement in \\\\u201coff\\\\u201d time and in \\\\u201con\\\\u201d time']\n",

The specific motor deficits that result from cerebellar lesions depend on which functional component of the CHAPTER 9 Organization of Motor Function cerebellum is most affected. If the flocculonodular lobe is damaged, the motor disorders resemble those produced by a lesion of the vestibular apparatus; such disorders include difficulty in balance and in gait and often nystagmus. If the vermis is affected, the motor disturbance affects the trunk, and if the intermediate region or hemisphere is involved, motor disorders occur in the limbs. The part of the limbs affected depends on the site of damage; hemispheric lesions affect the distal muscles more than paravermal lesions do.', 'Neurology_Adams.

In such patients, the cerebellar disturbance is often limited to abnormal stance and gait and the pathologic changes are restricted to the anterior parts of the superior vermis.

      "retrieved contexts: ['Psichiatry_DSM-5. There may also be an increased frequency of anxiety symptoms (e.g., fear of social situa- tions) or anxiety disorders. These mood and anxiety disturbances frequently remit follow- ing effective treatment of the bulimia nervosa. The lifetime prevalence of substance use, particularly alcohol or stimulant use, is at least 30% among individuals with bulimia ner- vosa. Stimulant use often begins in an attempt to control appetite and weight. A substan- tial percentage of individuals with bulimia nervosa also have personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders, most frequently borderline personality disorder. Diagnostic Criteria 307.51 (F50.8) A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following: 1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances.', 'Psichiatry_DSM-5. Bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders commonly co-occur with anorexia nervosa. Many individuals with anorexia nervosa report the presence of either an anxiety disorder or symptoms prior to onset of their eating disorder. OCD is described in some individuals with anorexia nervosa, especially those with the restricting type. Alcohol use disorder and other substance use disorders may also be comorbid with anorexia nervosa, especially among those with the binge-eating/purging type. Diagnostic Criteria 307.51 (F50.2) A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following: 1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances. 2.

The immediate cause of arterial, predominantly coronary thrombosis is almost always cracking or fissuring of the cap of an atheromatous plaque.

The thrombi tend to extend into the arterial lumen, causing obstruction to blood flow and clinical symptoms and signs.

Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to an isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction. Six weeks before the induction of myocardial infarction, some of the animals had been orchiectomized or ovariectomized. The animals were autopsied at regularly timed intervals on days 1, 2, 3, 8, and 15 after myocardial infarction. The gonadectomized animals manifested less severe untoward changes, survived in greater numbers, and experienced superior repair of their damaged hearts. Circulating levels of enzymes (e.g., CPK, GOT, GPT, and LDH), lipids, glucose, and BUN rose and fell during the acute necrosis and repair phases with distinct differences between the intact and castrated animals. Reciprocal changes in the weight of the adrenal and thymus glands, coupled with dynamic changes in circulating corticosterone levels, reflected marked temporal changes in the spectrum of adrenal steroids being secreted, as well as gonadal hormone mediated changes affecting adrenocortical function. The implications of these findings are that adrenocortical, androgenic, and estrogenic hormones condition the nature of the pathophysiologic response to acute myocardial infarction in rats.', 'Myocardial sensitivity to catecholamines following exposure of rats to irregular, signalled footshock. Emotional stress is associated with an increased activity of both the pituitary-adrenal cortical system and the sympathetic-adrenal medullary systems resulting in raised plasma levels of glucocorticoids and catecholamines. There is evidence to suggest that prolonged stress induced adrenergic hyperactivity initiated myocardial pathogenesis and that this may relate to a corticosteroid catecholamine interaction. In the present study driven atrial strips removed from stressed male CSF rats were found to exhibit an enhanced sensitivity to both norepinephrine and epinephrine. These animals had previously been subjected to irregular foot shock associated with a warning signal; a situation producing a high plasma steroid level. The enhanced myocardial sensitivity to both catecholamines was observed in naive animals subjected to a single period, and persisted unchanged in animals stressed daily over a 28 day period. The hypersensitivity of the myocardium observed immediately after stress was maintained for at least 24 hr, whereas the circulating steroid level had returned to control values within 3 hr. In animals subjected to regular stress without a warning signal, a situation producing a much lower steroid level, no enhanced myocardial sensitivity was observed. While the aetiology of the phenomenon of enhanced myocardial sensitivity to catecholamines is not entirely understood, the evidence presented suggests that it may be related to the extreme elevation of circulating glucocorticoids. The sensitivity of the vas deferens however, was unaltered even though the animals were subjected to the stressor producing a high plasma steroid level.

Controlled ovarian stimulation\\\\u2014In the controlled ovarian stimulation that provides multiple mature oocytes for assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization, it is critical to suppress an endogenous LH surge that could prematurely trigger ovulation. This suppression is most commonly achieved by daily subcutaneous injections of leuprolide or daily nasal applications of nafarelin. For leuprolide, treatment is commonly initiated with 1 mg daily for about 10 days until menstrual bleeding occurs. At that point, the dose is reduced to 0.5 mg daily until hCG is administered (Figure 37\\\\u20133). For nafarelin, the beginning dosage is generally 400 mcg twice a day, which is decreased to 200 mcg when menstrual bleeding occurs. 2.', 'Pharmacology_Katzung. In men, FSH is the primary regulator of spermatogenesis, whereas LH is the main stimulus for testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells. FSH helps maintain high local androgen concentrations in the vicinity of developing sperm by stimulating the production of androgen-binding protein in Sertoli cells. FSH also stimulates the conversion by Sertoli cells of testosterone to estrogen that is also required for spermatogenesis. FSH, LH, and hCG are available in several pharmaceutical forms. They are used in states of infertility to stimulate spermatogenesis in men and to induce follicle development and ovulation in women.

There is a vast amount of literature which indicates that alkylating agents, procarbazine and irradiation are leukemogenic and immunosuppressive in animals and man. It is than conceivable that the current intensive treatment programs which use these agents are promoting the development of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). This leukemia has occurred most often in patients whose Hodgkin's disease is poorly controlled and who have received more aggressive therapy. The latent period from the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease to the diagnosis of leukemia is significantly shorter (p less than .0005) in those patients who have received intensive and near maximal radiotherapy (total nodal irradiation), combination chemotherapy (MOPP or equivalent) or a sequential combination of the two modalities than similar patients who were treated with less than total nodal irradiation and or single agent chemotherapy. The following characteristic features have occurred with sufficient frequency to suggest that the subsequent leukemia is a distinct clinicopathological entity: pancytopenia, megaloblastoid marrow, nucleated red blood cells in the peripheral blood, random chromosomal aberrations of the bone marrow in most patients (94%), and refractoriness to antileukemia therapy (response rate 6.5%) with a very short survival (median one month).\"]\n",

Patients will be assigned to receive either amiodarone or placebo. Eligible patients include those with ischemic and nonischemic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or VI) and with 10 or more ventricular premature beats per hour.

Whatever the mechanism involved, responses of the cell to changes in the environment become inappropriate. This paper successively reviews the various categories of proto-oncogenes, the mechanisms by which proto-oncogenes can be activated, and several examples of tumor suppressor genes.

The effects of various anti-Ig antibodies on different B lymphocyte functions were investigated. With the proper accessory cofactor(s) derived from serum, anti-IgM antibodies induced a vigorous proliferative response in normal adult murine B cells, while polyspecific anti-Ig and anti-IgD had no effect. Without the required cofactor, all three anti-Ig antibodies were inhibitory for mitogenic responses. All three anti-Ig antibodies were also inhibitory for mitogen-induced antibody responses with or without the cofactor. Even with the required cofactor, neonatal B cells as well as adult C3H/HeJ B cells were not triggered into proliferation by anti-IgM. Finally, the cofactor required for anti-IgM-triggered mitogenesis was shown to be generated from serum by 2-mercaptoethanol and to be approximately 65,000 in molecular weight.

In addition, the proliferative response of in vivo-activated B cells and lymphokine-driven B cell proliferation were also found to be sensitive to FK506. Interestingly, FK506 did not affect the expression of activation antigens such as CD23, IL-2 receptor (CD25), and transferrin receptor (CD71). Finally, FK506 had little effect on B cell antibody generation in a T cell-independent system.

The aim of the present study is to elucidate whether platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TxA2) participates in enhancement of vasoconstractile response to a pressor agent. Platelet aggregation was extraluminally induced by application of collagen to autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP), and then the PRP treated with collagen was infused into the perfusion system by means of a small infusion pump. All the prostanoids in the perfusate were assayed radioimmunologically. Infusion into the perfusion system of PRP treated with collagen, as well as that of untreated PRP, apparently caused pronounced enhancement of vasocontractile response to noradrenaline (NA), accompanied by elevations of both the level of TxB2, a stable metabolite of TxA2, and the TxB2/prostaglandin E (PGE) ratio. In addition, treatment with either OKY-046 (a Tx A2 synthetase inhibitor) or ketanserin (a selective S2-serotonergic antagonist) resulted in diminution of the raised vasoconstrictor response to NA induced by application of collagen to PRP. Thus, it is possible to draw the conclusion that platelet-derived TxA2, is as potent a vasoactive substance as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and at least in part, contributes to the enhancement of vasocontractile response to NA (NA-R) during raised platelet aggregability.']\n",

      "retrieved contexts: ['Sustained antithrombotic activity of hirudin after its plasma clearance: comparison with heparin. Thrombus extension in patients with venous thromboembolism is due to the accretion of fibrin onto existing thrombi. Extension is promoted by both circulating and thrombus-bound thrombin, which convert fibrinogen to fibrin. Heparin is an effective antithrombotic agent, but it requires continuous administration to achieve persistent inhibition of thrombus extension. Heparin is highly effective in inhibiting fluid phase thrombin, but is a relatively ineffective inhibitor of thrombus-bound thrombin. Hirudin, unlike heparin, inactivates both circulating and fibrin-bound thrombin and, therefore, has the potential to prevent thrombus extension even after a short course of treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the time course of the accretion of new fibrin onto preexisting rabbit jugular vein thrombi after a 3-hour infusion of saline, heparin, and hirudin. Heparin and recombinant (r)-hirudin (CGP 39399) were infused at doses that doubled the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). At the end of the 3-hour infusions in rabbits treated with saline, heparin (0.75 mg/kg), or r-hirudin (1.25 mg/kg), accretion of 125I-fibrinogen was 59 +/- 5 micrograms, 34 +/- 4 micrograms, and 21 +/- 2 micrograms, respectively (heparin and r-hirudin v saline, P less than .01; r-hirudin v heparin, P less than .01). Three hours after the end of the infusions, the accreted 125I-fibrinogen in the saline-, heparin-, and hirudin-treated animals was 89 +/- 6 micrograms, 51 +/- 7 micrograms, and 23 +/- 3 micrograms, respectively; 9 hours after the end of the infusions, the accreted 125I-fibrinogen was 112 +/- 9 micrograms, 82 +/- 7 micrograms, and 25 +/- 3 micrograms, respectively. aPTT and thrombin clotting time (TCT) returned to the baseline value 90 minutes after the end of heparin or r-hirudin infusion. During in vitro experiments, human fibrin clots previously incubated in human plasma containing r-hirudin did not promote fibrinopeptide A (FPA) generation when washed and then incubated in human plasma in the absence of thrombin inhibitors. This persistent inhibition of FPA production was not observed after incubation in human plasma of human plasma clots preincubated with heparin. We conclude that heparin is effective in inhibiting thrombus extension while it is present in the circulation, but that this effect is rapidly lost after its plasma clearance. In contrast, the antithrombotic activity of r-hirudin is sustained beyond its plasma clearance, presumably because of its ability to inactivate thrombus-bound thrombin. Our findings indicate that r-hirudin might be an effective antithrombotic agent even when used for short periods.', 'Effects of heparin, dermatan sulfate and of their association on the inhibition of venous thrombosis growth in the rabbit. This study compares the ability of unfractionated heparin, of dermatan sulfate, and of their simultaneous administration delivered as continuous intravenous infusion or as a single bolus injection to inhibit the growth of a standardized venous thrombosis in the rabbit. When delivered as continuous intravenous infusion for 4 h, heparin and dermatan sulfate inhibited thrombus growth in a dose dependent manner. The maximum antithrombotic effect of heparin was achieved at the dose of 0.15 mg kg-1 h-1 (25 U kg-1 h-1) which generated a mean plasma concentration of 1.8 micrograms ml-1 (0.31 U ml-1) and a 1.8 fold prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in comparison to the pretreatment value. A comparable antithrombotic effect was obtained with dermatan sulfate at the dose of 2 mg kg-1 h-1. This dose generated a mean plasma concentration of 30 micrograms ml-1 and a 1.3 fold APTT prolongation. Increasing these doses up to 10 fold did not improve the antithrombotic effect which did not overpass 60-70% of the controls. When the compounds were delivered simultaneously, the maximum antithrombotic effect (64%) was obtained with the following association: 0.06 mg kg-1 h-1 (10 U kg-1 h-1) for heparin and 1 mg kg-1 h-1 for dermatan sulfate. Increasing these doses up to 4 to 5 fold did not improve the antithrombotic effect.

Indobufen is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation which acts by reversibly inhibiting the platelet cyclo-oxygenase enzyme. Improvements in walking distances and microcirculatory parameters have been achieved during therapy with indobufen in patients with peripheral vascular disease and intermittent claudication. Indobufen has been shown to be as effective as aspirin plus dipyridamole in preventing the reocclusion of coronary and femoro-popliteal artery bypass grafts and has been shown to significantly reduce platelet deposition on haemodialysis membranes. Initial studies have also indicated that indobufen may have a prophylactic effect on the incidence of secondary thrombotic events following transient ischaemic attack or mild stroke and may be effective in the prophylaxis of migraine. Indobufen is well tolerated following oral administration and has been associated with a low incidence of adverse effects rarely requiring withdrawal of treatment. Thus, available evidence indicates that indobufen may be an effective alternative to aspirin for the treatment of cerebral, peripheral and coronary vascular diseases with the advantage of a lower incidence of gastrointestinal effects compared to high dose aspirin, rendering indobufen more suitable for longer term therapy.', 'Altered platelet function in diabetes mellitus. An increased sensitivity of platelets to aggregation from ADP and  epinephrine is described in diabetics with or without vascular disease. This sensitivity correlates with elevated levels on von Willebrand factor (vWF), which, in turn appears to be influenced by growth hormone. VWF activity correlates with previously described \\\\\"plasma factor\\\\\" activity. Platelets from diabetic subjects are more sensitive than platelets from normal subjects to arachidonic acid-induced aggregation. This sensitivity is abolished by aspirin, which is a prostaglandin synthetase (cyclo-oxygenase) inhibitor. Platelets from diabetc subjects synthesize increased amounts of PGE2-like material (iPGE) in response to ADP, epinephrine, collagen, and arachidonic acid. The latter finding suggests that a fundamental mechanism for increased platelet aggregation in diabetes is increased prostaglandin synthetase activity. Therapeutic endeavors that would lower growth hormone levels, vWF activity, and/or prostaglandin synthetase activity may be of benefit in the prophylaxis of diabetic vascular disease. Prospective studies are needed to explore these hypothesis, as are more studies on the precise mechanisms and platelet aggregation in diabetes mellitus.']\n",

This paper reports the results of a forensic pathological study of 89 autopsy cases of Sudden Coronary Death (SCD). Of 89 cases, 63 (52 male, 11 female) were narrowed by 76-100% in cross-sectional area (XSA) of the coronary artery (CA) and 26 (22 male, 4 female), by 51-75%. Atherosclerotic plaques in the CA were serious and extensive, especially in the left anterior descending and often involved several branches of CA at the same time. Recent thrombosis was found in 18 cases, haemorrhage in plaques in 17 cases. Only 2 cases had visible acute myocardial infarction. Inflammatory cell infiltration was found in coronary plaques in 36 cases. Myocardial fibrosis or small scar formation was detected in 51 cases. It is suggested that although the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) is low in China, SCD is the commonest mode of Sudden Unexpected Death. The majority of SCD (52%) were middle aged males (30-49 years old). Most of the cases died suddenly during sleep without any clear precipitating factors. The characteristics of occurrence and pathological changes in the CA and myocardium and the pathological diagnosis of SCD are also analysed and discussed.', 'Precursors of sudden coronary death.  Factors related to the incidence of sudden death. Precursors of sudden death were sought in men--1838 civil servants in Albany, New York, and 2282 residents of Framingham, Massachusetts--under continuous surveillance for 16 years. In men 45-74 years old there were 234 deaths attributed to coronary heart disease (CHD) of which 109 occurred within one hour of onset of symptoms. More than half of all deaths due to CHD occurred outside the hospital and about 80 per cent of these were sudden. Most were unheralded by prior symptoms of CHD. Persons at high risk of death from CHD, including sudden death, can be identified long before the terminal unexpected catastrophe. The same precursive stigmata exist in persons subject ot coronary attacks whether or not immediately fatal. The risk of sudden death in these two populations was positively correlated with high blood pressure, the electrocardiographic pattern of left ventricular enlargement, obesity, and heavy cigarette usage. Sudden death is a common and possibly incidental expression of lethal coronary heart disease. The potential candidate for sudden death cannot be confidently distinguished from the individual who succumbs more slowly of myocardial infarction. The inescapable conclusion is that the prevention of sudden death requires the prevention of coronary attacks.']\n",

The final common pathway for LSDs is the accumulation of specific macromolecules within tissues and cells that normally have a high flux of these substrates. The majority of lysosomal enzyme deficiencies result from point mutations or genetic rearrangements at a locus that encodes a single lysosomal hydrolase. However, some mutations cause deficiencies of several different lysosomal hydrolases by alteration of the enzymes/proteins involved in targeting, active site modifications, or macromolecular association or trafficking. All LSDs are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders except for Hunter (mucopolysaccharidosis type II), Danon, and Fabry diseases, which are X-linked. Substrate accumulation leads to lysosomal distortion, which has significant pathologic consequences. In addition, abnormal amounts of metabolites may also have pharmacologic effects important to disease pathophysiology and propagation.', 'Lysosomal storage diseases. The majority of lysosomal storage diseases affect the central nervous system. Those that reflect a primary lysosomal disorder are associated with genetically determined deficiencies of specific lysosomal enzymes and storage of the relevant substrate. Autofluorescent lipopigments accumulate in the ceroid-lipofuscinoses, a heterogeneous group of diseases in which lysosomal storage is thought to be a secondary event. In animals, there occurs a group of toxic storage diseases whose pathology mimics that of some of the genetic diseases.

Apart from the usual hazards of local anesthesia (toxic reaction due to overdose or intravasal administration, allergic reaction, reaction to the vasoconstrictor), a further risk which should be borne in mind in local anesthesia of the neck region is inadvertent epidural or intrathecal administration of the local anesthetic agent. Depression of respiration or total respiratory failure may occur due to blockade of the superficially located medullary chemoreceptors in the form of a high or total spinal block. The pathogenesis of these incidents is investigated. Respiratory failure is usually reversible and requires immediate and effective therapy (artificial respiration, oxygen administration). The indications for neck anesthesia and their relativity within the entire therapeutic program should be given careful consideration. If (radicular) pain occurs during the injection, or if cerebrospinal fluid is aspirated, the procedure should be interrupted immediately and some time allowed to elapse. In fatal cases the injection channel must be dissected layer-wise in local anemia down to the dural sac. The possible pathway of toxic administration (epidural, subdural, intravasal) must be demonstrated chemically.', 'Adverse effects of local anaesthetics. Local anaesthetics are responsible for 5 to 10% of all reported adverse reactions to anaesthetic drugs. Adverse effects may be classified as: (a) those associated directly with blocking ion channels in cell membranes, such as cardiovascular and CNS toxicity; (b) those due to other effects of drug or vehicle (mainly peripheral nerve complications); (c) allergic reactions (often a mistaken diagnosis); and (d) mechanical or other effects of technique, such as needle trauma or introduction of infection. Signs and symptoms of CNS toxicity include convulsions, followed by coma and respiratory depression. Convulsions are due to disinhibition of nervous conduction, probably by an action at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex, while depressant effects, which predominate at higher doses, are due to blockade of sodium channels. CNS toxicity is potentiated by hypoxia and hypercapnia, so acute management must minimise these. Cardiovascular toxicity also involves sodium channel blockade, reducing contractility and interfering with conduction. Bupivacaine differs from lidocaine (lignocaine) in the sudden occurrence of dangerous ventricular arrhythmias including fibrillation at subconvulsant doses. Ropivacaine is a newer amide local anaesthetic with toxicity intermediate between these but potency similar to bupivacaine. Neurotoxic complications leading to prolonged deficit after intraspinal administration are uncommon. Causes are multifactorial, and include pH of and additives to preparations.

Signaling by MAPK cascades is facilitated by specialized scaffold proteins that bind to all three kinases in a particular MAPK relay, thereby accelerating their interactions. The scaffold protein kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) functions in the Raf/MEK1/Erk pathway. During T-cell receptor signaling, KSR associates with Raf, MEK1, and Erk and localizes itself and its cargo to the membrane. In that location, activated Ras can engage with the Raf bound to KSR and trigger the kinase relay (see Fig. 7.19). An important function of MAPKs is to phosphorylate and activate transcription factors that can then induce new gene expression.

The tape-recorded EEG was filtered at 1-25 c/sec, and 128 individual responses were summed, sampling every 0.5 msec for 250 msec post-stimulation. The Cz AERs showed the classic vertex response, a negative peak, N1, at 100 msec, followed by a positive peak, P2, at 160-200 msec. The T3 and T4 AERs were similar to the Cz AERs from 0 to 80 msec and from 200 to 250 msec. They differed significantly from the Cz AERs from 80 to 200 msec. The difference is best explained by the hypothesis that the Cz AERs consisted of N1P2, while the T3 and T4 AERs consisted of N1P2 plus an additional superimposed component, which we called the T complex, comprising a positive peak, Ta, at 105-110 msec, and a negative peak, Tb, at 150-160 msec. By computer, the corresponding Cz and T3 or T4 AERs were normalized to equalize their amplitudes, and the former was subtracted from the latter, thus isolating the T complex. The Ta peak was found to occur 1.5 +/- 1.6 msec earlier at the electrode contralateral to stimulation, and 2.2 +/- 4.0 msec earlier at the T4 (right) electrode. Both differences were statistically significant. The T complex amplitude was greater at the electrode contralateral to stimulation and at the T4 electrode.

Experimental evidence suggests that different neural generators contribute to the two responses. Furthermore, it appears that the temporal response principally reflects activity of the primary auditory pathway while the midline response reflects non-primary pathways. Although it is known that neurons throughout the auditory pathway exhibit distinct binaural interaction (BI) properties, thus far there have been no systematic attempts to differentiate the MLR wave forms in response to binaural stimulation. The purpose of this study was to determine if binaural click stimulation could functionally differentiate the midline and temporal MLR responses in the guinea pig. Binaural click stimulation caused a significant decrease in temporal MLR peak amplitudes, and a significant increase in midline MLR amplitudes. The fact that different BI patterns were observed suggests that the two MLR components are functionally distinct.

Thus, for example, tumors arising in the head of the pancreas often cause chronic pancreatitis in the distal parenchyma, while diabetes caused by duct obstruction and subsequent pancreatitis may be the manifestation of an underlying neoplasm. In fact, approximately 1% of the older adult population with new-onset diabetes harbor an unsuspected pancreatic cancer.

      "retrieved contexts: ['Atrial receptors and renal function. The hypothesis that receptors in the heart or pulmonary vasculature initiate a reflex that influences urine flow was derived from experiments designed to evaluate the effect of mechanical ventilation on renal function.  These experiments indicated that urine flow usually decreases during positive-pressure breathing and usually increases during negative-pressure breathing.  It was surmised that impulses from certain cardiopulmonary receptors affect the secretion of ADH, which in turn influences urine flow.  A subsequent investigation appeared to localize the pertinent receptors to the left atrium, but the results of this particular investigation were influenced by several complication factors that have not been widely appreciated.  The apparent localization of volume-regulating recpetors to the left atrium and the accumulating evidence that atrial receptors do respond to changes in atrial pressure or atrial volume triggered a myriad of further studies on the function of left receptors.  Nearly all these studies employed indirect techniques that produced changes in systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics in addition to changes in left atrial pressure.  Nevertheless, it often was assumed that if changes in left pressure were produced, any concomitant changes in circulating ADH or in urine flow were attributable to a reflex elicited from atrial receptors.  Mush of the data obtained were interpreted as being compatible with the elft atrial volume-receptor hypothesis, but very liggle of the data pertained to left atrial receptors specifically.', 'Atrial reflexes and renal function. Distension of small balloons in the venous-atrial junctions results in an increase in heart rate, urinary flow and sodium excretion. Two types of atrial receptors are described: one type, histologically known, discharging into myelinated fibers, and a second type, discharging into nonmyelinated (\\\\\"C\\\\\") fibers. These responses are mediated by the myelinated fibers. Experiments have shown that simulation of receptors discharging into the large myelinated vagal fibers is responsible for a reflex increase in heart rate mediated only by sympathetic nerves and for an increase in urinary flow. The efferent pathway of the diuretic response is shown to be nervous and hormonal. Stimulation of atrial receptors causes (1) a reduction of activity in nerves to the kidney, causing an increase in both urinary volume and sodium excretion, and (2) the release of a blood-borne agent, possibly diuretic, that increases urinary volume but does not affect sodium excretion.']\n",

Irregular black deposits of clumped pigment in the peripheral retina, called bone spicules because of their vague resemblance to the spicules of cancellous bone, give the disease its name (Fig. 39-18). The name is actually a misnomer because retinitis pigmentosa is not an inflammatory process.

Literature data indicate that the formation of ribosomes is a basic function of the nucleolus. The formation of the nucleolus depends upon the function of the nucleolus organizing region (NOR). It was shown that in man the NOR locus is situated in secondary constrictions and adjacent segments of the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes of the D and G group. The presence of DNA sequences coding for 18 S and 28 S RNA i.e. ribosomal RNA (r-RNA), was demonstrated in the secondary constriction of acrocentric chromosomes using the RNA-DNA hybridization in situ method. The genes coding for 5 S RNA which is also a component of ribosomes, are located on other chromosomes.

Hence the following question: do changes in the NOR \\\\\"dose\\\\\" cause changes in ribosome production? Eventual changes should influence the intensity and/or the time course of r-RNA synthesis in cells stimulated to growth and differentiation . An approximate index for the study of this phenomenon is the 3H-uridine incorporation in an adequate experimental system.

Sucrase-isomaltase (SI) is an enterocyte-specific gene which exhibits a complex pattern of expression during intestinal development and in the adult intestinal mucosa. In the studies described in this report, we demonstrate that enterocyte-specific transcription of the SI gene is regulated by an evolutionarily conserved promoter that extends approximately 180 bp upstream of the transcription start site. DNase I footprint analysis allowed the identification of three nuclear protein-binding sites within the SI promoter (SIF1, SIF2, and SIF3 [SI footprint]), each of which acted as a positive regulatory element for transcription in intestinal cell lines. SIF1 was shown to bind nuclear protein complexes present in primary mouse small intestinal cell and in an intestinal cell line (Caco-2). However, SIF1-binding proteins were absent in a variety of other epithelial and nonepithelial cells. In vitro mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the SIF1 site is required for high-level promoter activity in intestinal cells. The SIF3 element formed prominent binding complexes with intestinal and liver nuclear extracts, whereas nuclear proteins from other epithelial and nonepithelial cells formed weaker complexes of different mobilities. The SIF2 element bound nuclear proteins in a pattern similar to that of SIF3, and cross-competition studies suggested that SIF2 and SIF3 may bind the same nuclear proteins. Taken together, these data have allowed the identification of novel DNA-binding proteins that play an important role in regulating intestine-specific transcription of the SI gene.', \"Bacteriophage and spliceosomal proteins function as position-dependent cis/trans repressors of mRNA translation in vitro. The translational regulation of ferritin expression currently represents the only well characterized example for eukaryotic translational control by high affinity interactions between a specific cytoplasmic protein, iron regulatory factor [IRF], and an mRNA-binding site, the iron-responsive element [IRE], located in the 5' untranslated region [UTR] of ferritin mRNAs. To elucidate whether IRE/IRF may represent the first physiological example of a more general mechanism for mRNA-specific translational control, high affinity RNA-binding sites for the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein or the spliceosomal protein U1A were introduced into the 5' UTR of capped chloramphenicol acetyltransferase [CAT] transcripts. In the absence of these RNA-binding proteins, CAT mRNA was efficiently translated. Addition of purified MS2 coat protein or U1A caused a specific, dose-dependent repression of CAT biosynthesis in rabbit reticulocyte and wheat germ in vitro translation systems. The translational blockage imposed by the RNA/protein complex was reversible and did not alter the stability of the repressed mRNAs. Translational repression caused by binding of U1A or MS2 proteins to their target mRNAs is shown to be position-dependent in vitro.

For the host control of an opportunistic fungal pathogen such as C. albicans, we have definitive evidence to indicate that LGL can respond to C. albicans by producing key cytokines, i.e. TNF, IFNg, and GMCSF, to activate neutrophil function against C. albicans. The cytokine-producing LGL differs from the spontaneous tumoricidal LGL by being DR+; otherwise other markers are identical, i.e., CD2(+)-CD16+CD4-CD8-CD15-. From the point of view of the neutrophils, they can respond to these cytokines readily within 2 hr of activation and may utilize any of the 3 antifungal pathways, i.e., oxidative radical production, enzyme degranulation, and lactoferrin release, to control Candida. It is of importance to note that TNF and GMCSF have also been shown to have chemotactic properties on neutrophils (27,28). Thus, the cytokines produced by LGL may have bifunctional roles for PMN, in not only activating them but in mobilizing them to the site of fungal invasion. In addition, we have defined that C. albicans as well as the bacterial polysaccharide, LPS, can activate PMN to produce TNF. Since TNF is a neutrophil activating factor, this implies that neutrophils may self-regulate function in an autocrine manner or utilize released TNF to recruit neighboring PMN. The possibility exists that other cytokines may also be produced by neutrophils when activated with C. albicans. Future studies should indicate the true role of neutrophils in host resistance to infection and may lead to a new identity for neutrophils as an active participant in the afferent phase of the immune response rather than an end effector cell population, waiting for outside signals to mobilize and activate them.', 'Pediatrics_Nelson.

      "retrieved contexts: ['A chloride channel widely expressed in epithelial and non-epithelial cells. Chloride channels have several functions, including the regulation of cell volume, stabilizing membrane potential, signal transduction and transepithelial transport. The plasma membrane Cl- channels already cloned belong to different structural classes: ligand-gated channels, voltage-gated channels, and possibly transporters of the ATP-binding-cassette type (if the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator is a Cl- channel). The importance of chloride channels is illustrated by the phenotypes that can result from their malfunction: cystic fibrosis, in which transepithelial transport is impaired, and myotonia, in which ClC-1, the principal skeletal muscle Cl- channel, is defective. Here we report the properties of ClC-2, a new member of the voltage-gated Cl- channel family. Its sequence is approximately 50% identical to either the Torpedo electroplax Cl- channel, ClC-0 (ref. 8), or the rat muscle Cl- channel, ClC-1 (ref. 9). Isolated initially from rat heart and brain, it is also expressed in pancreas, lung and liver, for example, and in pure cell lines of fibroblastic, neuronal, and epithelial origin, including tissues and cells affected by cystic fibrosis. Expression in Xenopus oocytes induces Cl- currents that activate slowly upon hyperpolarization and display a linear instantaneous current-voltage relationship. The conductivity sequence is Cl- greater than or equal to Br- greater than I-. The presence of ClC-2 in such different cell types contrasts with the highly specialized expression of ClC-1 (ref. 9) and also with the cloned cation channels, and suggests that its function is important for most cells.', \"Molecular determinants of channel function. The 40 years since the seminal papers of Hodgkin and Huxley appeared have been extraordinarily productive in terms of understanding the molecular basis for electrical activity. The Hodgkin-Huxley proposal that electrical excitability should be understood in terms of voltage-dependent changes in discrete sites has been resoundingly verified. Indeed, the Hodgkin-Huxley framework is remarkable in that its essential elements have remained largely intact as molecular understanding has advanced. This robustness is, at least in part, a result of the fact that Hodgkin and Huxley developed a mathematical model, based on simple physical arguments, that was sufficiently comprehensive to describe the kinetics of the voltage-clamped currents and yet simple enough to be predictive. The predictive features were demonstrated early by the reconstruction of both space-clamped and propagated action potentials on a desk-top calculator (293) and, later, when the sites of Hodgkin and Huxley developed into being well-characterized molecular structures. Voltage- and ligand-dependent ion-selective channels are now the established framework within which cellular electrophysiology is being pursued. Moreover, electrophysiological measurements of membrane and single-channel currents have become essential tools to examine molecular questions pertaining to channel structure and activity. The last 10 years have witnessed spectacular activity, which has resulted from two developments, the giga-seal patch clamp (249) and the elucidation of primary sequences of a number of channel-forming proteins (494), along with the first outlines of their low-resolution three-dimensional structures (651). The stage is now set for 1) applying a variety of convergent techniques to decipher molecular structural details at high resolution, and 2) seeking to understand the complex dynamic functions, gating, and ion selectivity at the molecular level. The early successes are likely to be in understanding the molecular determinants of ion conductance and selectivity, initially in terms of quantitative descriptions of how a sequence modification can alter a channel's permeability characteristics. Channel gating is a far more elusive target because it involves molecular rearrangements, which are poorly understood at any level of description and which may be modified by the channel's environment. The general mechanisms of ion permeation and gating will differ among different classes of ion channels, but a molecular understanding of either phenomenon must eventually be based on an understanding of intermolecular forces, which are invariant among all channel types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\"]\n",

Oligohydramnios detected before 36 weeks' gestation in the presence of normal fetal anatomy and growth is generally managed expectantly in conjunction with enhanced fetal surveillance. However, evidence of fetal or maternal compromise will override potential complications from preterm delivery. Antepartum management of oligohydramnios may include maternal hydration.

However, it was not clear whether this translated into better pregnancy outcomes (Gizzo, 2015).\", 'Maternal and fetal plasma levels of free corticosteroids in pathological deliveries. Does intrauterine acidosis induce increased steroid secretion? The concentration of free steroids (CS) increases in both fetal and maternal plasma during labor and delivery. Fetal levels are higher after vaginal than after cesarean section. These differences may indicate an important role of the fetal adrenal gland in the induction of labor or they may reflect merely the fetal response to the stress of delivery. During incrased intrauterine stress steroid secretion is increased as shown here. We examined 41 mothers and their infants during pathological labor. Pathology was assessed from fetal acidosis and/or a clinically obstetric disease of the mother or fetus. The 41 cases included 9 cesarean sections, 8 forceps deliveries; 24 spontaneous deliveries of which 7 were premature. At the time of delivery the pH and CS level were determined in maternal and umbilical vessels in all cases. During spontaneous labor blood samples were also taken during the different stages of labour. A competetive protein binding assay with transcortin without fractionation of the steroids was used. Progesteron was determined by the same assay. The level of this hormone, however, remains unchanged and hence any changes reflect changes in CS. The levels of CS were correlated with the pH values and compared to previously obtained normal values. During pathological deliveries CS levels in both mother and fetus are normal as long as there is no acidosis (Fig. 1). If acidosis is present the CS level in the umbilical artery is usually higher than normal. In 13 out of 18 vaginal deliveries the CS level was above normal, in the other 5 at the upper limit of normal (Fig. 1 and 2).

Similar dependence on the pH was found for cesarean sections (Tab. III). In premature deliveries without acidosis in the umbilical artery the CS levels were lower in both mother and fetus (Tab. I).

For a disease to be classified as autoimmune, the tissue damage must be shown to be caused by the adaptive immune response to self antigens. Autoinflammatory reactions directed against the commensal microbiota of the intestines, such as those seen in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), are a special case in that the target antigens are not strictly \\\\u2018self,\\\\u2019 but are derived from the \\\\u2018extended self\\\\u2019 of the intestinal microbiota. IBD, nevertheless, shares immunopathogenic features with other autoimmune diseases. The most convincing proof that the immune response is causal in autoimmunity is the transfer of disease by transferring the active component of the immune response to an appropriate recipient.

Cancer metastasis poses the greatest challenge to the eradication of malignancy. The majority of clinical and experimental evidence indicates that metastasis is a non-random, organ-specific process. Tumor cell interaction with endothelium and subendothelial matrix constitutes the most crucial factor in determining the organ preference of metastasis. A plethora of cell surface adhesion molecules, which encompass four major families (i.e., integrins, cadherins, immunoglobulins and selectins) and many other unclassified molecules, mediate tumor-host interactions. Adhesion molecules and adhesion processes are involved in most, if not all, of the intermediate steps of the metastatic cascade. Decreased E-cadherin expression and increased CD44 expression are clearly correlated with the acquisition of the invasive capacity of primary tumor cells. Similarly, altered expression pattern of many other adhesion molecules such as upregulated expression of the laminin receptors and depressed expression of fibronectin receptors (alpha 5 beta 1) appears to be involved in tumor cell invasion into the subendothelial matrix. Tumor cell-endothelium interactions involve several well-defined sequential steps that can be analyzed by the 'Docking and Locking' hypothesis at the molecular level. Tumor cell-matrix interactions are determined by the repertoire of adhesion receptors of tumor cells and the unique composition of organ-specific matrices. Our experimental data, together with others', suggest that the integrin alpha IIb beta 3 is one of the major players in these tumor-host interactions. Tumor-host interaction is a dynamic process which is constantly modulated by a host of factors including various cytokines, growth factors and arachidonate metabolites such as 12(S)-HETE. Delineation of the molecular mechanisms of tumor-host interactions may provide additional means to intervene in the metastatic process.\", \"Fatty acid modulation of tumor cell adhesion to microvessel endothelium and experimental metastasis. Tumor cell interaction with the endothelium of the vessel wall is a rate limiting step in metastasis. The fatty acid modulation of this interaction was investigated in low (LM) and high (HM) metastatic B16 amelanotic melanoma (B16a) cells. 12(S)-HETE increased the adhesion of LM cells to endothelium derived from pulmonary microvessels. All other monohydroxy and dihydroxy fatty acids were ineffective. LTB4 induced a modest stimulation but LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 as well as LXA4 and LXB4 were ineffective.

Intravenous injection of 12(S)-HETE treated LM cells resulted in increased lung colonization (experimental metastasis). This effect was specific for 12(S)-HETE and was inhibited by 13(S)-HODE but not by other HODE's. 12(S)-HETE also enhanced lung colonization by HM cells and 13(S)-HODE decreased lung colonization by HM cells.

Generally, drug hepatotoxicity is not more frequent in persons with underlying chronic liver disease, although the severity of the outcome may be amplified. Reported exceptions include hepatotoxicity of aspirin, methotrexate, isoniazid (only in certain experiences), antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection, and certain drugs such as conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation in the presence of hepatitis C.', 'Drug-induced liver disease. The large number of chemical agents administered for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes can produce various types of hepatic injury by several mechanism. Acute injury may be cytotoxic, cholestatic or mixed. Cytotoxic injury may consist of necrosis or steatosis. Cholestatic injury may be cholangiolitic (hepatocanalicular) or bland (canalicular). Chronic hepatic lesions caused by medicinal agents include chronic active hepatitis, steatosis, cirrhosis, fibrosis, hepatoportal sclerosis (non-cirrhotic portal hypertension), hepatic vein thrombosis, peliosis hepatis, adenoma, carcinoma, and angiosarcoma. There is a useful relationship between the type of hepatic injury and the chemical setting in which the drugs are employed. Some agents produce the liver damage because they are intrinsic (true, predictable) hepatotoxins. Other (non-predictable \\\\\"hepatotoxins\\\\\"), produce hepatic injury only in the rare and unusually susceptible individual (idiosyncratic injury). Hepatotoxic agents can be recognised by their dose-dependent and experimental reproducibility, properties which are not shared by agents which produce hepatic injury only in idiosyncratic hosts. Intrinsic hepatotoxins may be categorised as direct or indirect. Direct hepatotoxins injure the hepatocyte by direct physiochemical alteration and as a consequence produce metabolic defects. Indirect hepatotoxins selectively block metabolic pathways and, by producing a precise biochemical lesion, lead to structural changes. They may lead to hepatic steatosis or necrosis (cytotoxic indirect hepatotoxins) or block bile flow (cholestatic indirect hepatotoxins). Direct hepatotoxins are rarely encountered as drugs. Overdoses of some drugs and antineoplastic agents appear to be indirect cytotoxic hepatotoxins, and the C-17 alkylated anabolic and contraceptive steroids are indirect, cholestatic hepatotoxins.

Relative overexposure to this class of hormones is a risk factor for the subsequent development of endometrioid tumors. In contrast, progestins drive glandular maturation and are protective.

The stroma is crucial to the growth of the neoplasm, since it carries the blood supply and provides support for the growth of parenchymal cells.

Decreased sympathetic nerve activity leads to arteriolar dilation and an increase in renal plasma flow (RPF). Because the effect appears to be greater on the afferent arterioles, the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillary is increased, thereby increasing the GFR. Because RPF increases to a greater degree than GFR, the filtration fraction (GFR/RPF) decreases.

Grading of tumors on the basis of histological anaplasia, and the concept that tumor cells can be related to specific cytological stages of normal cellular development (cytogenetic classification) are presented. The World Health Organization system of classifying neural tumors is an attempt to develop a standardized classification scheme with as few interpretative controversies as possible, but it has required revision as new information has been gained. The major clinical and biological features of the commonest tumor groups are then discussed. It is unlikely that improvements in the classification of brain tumors will be based solely on histological information. Definitions of tumor entities that will provide more accurate prognoses and bases for effective therapy will require considerably more information at the molecular level than is currently available.', 'Pathologic tumor type and response to treatment. The general biology of the common primary brain tumors is reviewed, as are the results of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy for these neoplasms.

The development and consistent application of a widely acceptable nomenclature for brain tumors would be useful in the comparison of various therapies and for ease in communication. Further, a better general understanding of the biology of the various brain tumors is desirable. Reliable data relative to old or new forms of therapy seem to require national or regional studies in view of the relative rarity of some of these tumors. Except for medulloblastoma, the best results of therapy thus far are only slightly encouraging.

The two largest diameters and tumour volumes were measured and laboratory and immunological tests were performed before and after Ukrain administration.

The purpose of this review is to clarify for the nonneuropathologist some of the confusing issues concerning the classification of brain tumors. Following a short discussion of the commonly used methods to diagnose brain tumors clinically (frozen section, light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry), the general principles of classifying neural tumors are presented. Grading of tumors on the basis of histological anaplasia, and the concept that tumor cells can be related to specific cytological stages of normal cellular development (cytogenetic classification) are presented. The World Health Organization system of classifying neural tumors is an attempt to develop a standardized classification scheme with as few interpretative controversies as possible, but it has required revision as new information has been gained. The major clinical and biological features of the commonest tumor groups are then discussed. It is unlikely that improvements in the classification of brain tumors will be based solely on histological information. Definitions of tumor entities that will provide more accurate prognoses and bases for effective therapy will require considerably more information at the molecular level than is currently available.', 'Neurology_Adams. The recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification (fifth revision, 2016) represents a departure from previous systems because it depends to a large degree on genetic characteristics of the tumors. Table 30-2 shows the main features of the WHO grading system, using the notation of I-IV to denote the grade and presumed biologic behavior of tumors that incorporates both the histologic tumor type and the main genetic features. A discussion of this system can be found in the article by Louis and colleagues (2016). Each of the main tumor types is discussed below but, if nothing else, the table displays the large variety of tumors that occur in and around the brain.

In particular, the presence of acquired somatic mutations in the genes p53, 1p/19q codeletion, IDH1, TERT and in several other genes have led to reclassification of brain tumors, particularly those with genetic elements of both the astrocytic line and oligodendroglioma.

In young children, it may present with oral aversion, vomiting, and failure to thrive. In school-age children, it may present with vague abdominal pain or vomiting. In adolescents and adults, it presents with dysphagia and food impactions. These symptoms are attributed to the inflammatory response in the esophagus leading to edema and poor esophageal motility.', 'InternalMed_Harrison.

The diagnosis of asbestosis depends upon: (1) An adequate occupational exposure history. (2) Physical signs of pulmonary fibrosis. (3) Progressive radiological changes.

Acetylcholine-induced catecholamine secretion from isolated, perfused bovine adrenal medulla was strongly inhibited by hydrocortisone (30 micro M), estradiol (30 micro M), and estriol (30 micro M). Diethylistilbestrol (DES) (10 and 30 micro M) inhibited acetylcholine-induced secretion, and the effect of the higher dose was prolonged. Inhibition of high potassium-induced secretion by DES (30 micro M) indicated that hormonal inhibition of evoked secretion was not by competition for acetylcholine-sensitive receptor sites. Dehydrotestosterone (30 micro M) was ineffective in inhibiting acetylcholine-induced secrection. Hydrocortisone, estradiol, and estriol treatments enhanced nonstimulated release. It is suggested that incorporation of certain steroid into plasma and granule membranes, thereby modifying membrane function, enhances nonstimulated release and may also block evoked release of secretoy material.', 'Influences of extracellular calcium and potassium concentrations on adrenaline release and membrane potential in the perfused adrenal medulla of the rat.

The release of adrenaline in response to excess K was virtually abolished by the omission of [ca]o. The chromaffin cells were depolarized in proportion to logarithmic increase in the [K]o. Linear relations were thus obtained between the mean rates of adrenaline release and the membrane potential of chromaffin cells in the presence of different [Ca]o. Application of high K revived secretory response of a gland after prolonged exposure to acetylcholine in the presence of tetrodotoxin, when adrenaline release had declined below a half of the maximum response. Application of acetylcholine also revived secretory response after prolonged exposure to high K.

Recent improvements in radiation therapy of some malignancies in lower abdominal sites are leading to a prolongation of life in persons of child-bearing age. These successes require an evaluation of the possible undersirable consequences of the unavoidable gonadal irradiation that occurs in these cases. A review of radiobiological data from experimental animal studies and retrospective clinical studies suggests that in most instances human gonadal exposures in both sexes are insufficient to cause permanent sterility, because the exposures are fractionated and the total gonadal dose is much less than 600 rads. As a consequence, return of fertility must be anticipated, and the worrison questions of radiation-induced genetic damage in subsequent pregnancies must be addressed. This review did not substantiate this fear, because no case reports could be found of malformed infants among the progeny of previously irradiated parents. Some experimental studies suggest that radiation-damaged spermatogonia are self-destructive, but any evidence for this phenomenon in the ovary is nonexistent.

Although fatigue traditionally has been ascribed to the low cardiac output in HF, it is likely that skeletal-muscle abnormalities and other noncardiac comorbidities (e.g., anemia) also contribute to this symptom. In the early stages of HF, dyspnea is observed only during exertion; however, as the disease progresses, dyspnea occurs with less strenuous activity, and it ultimately may occur even at rest. The origin of dyspnea in HF is probably multifactorial (Chap. 47e). The most important mechanism is pulmonary congestion with accumulation of interstitial or intra-alveolar fluid, which activates juxtacapillary J receptors, which in turn stimulate the rapid, shallow breathing characteristic of cardiac dyspnea. Other factors that contribute to dyspnea on exertion include reductions in pulmonary compliance, increased airway resistance, respiratory muscle and/or diaphragm fatigue, and anemia.', 'InternalMed_Harrison.

We have heard today that psychological factors are extremely important in pain problems and that careful psychiatric assessment should delineate patients who have the potential of achieving good pain relief with interventional procedures. The bulwarks of the neurosurgical management of pain have been peripheral neurectomy, rhizotomy, sympathectomy, and cordotomy. We have heard each of these discussed. Peripheral neurectomy and rhizotomies are not highly successful in the treatment of pain, but are useful in carefully chosen patients. Cordotomy remains an excellent technique for the management of many patients with chronic pain or malignancy, and sympathectomy can be one of the most gratifying operations performed, as long as the patients are well chosen. The major lesson we have learned today is that there is no cure for pain at the present time. Nevertheless, neurosurgical procedures remain an important part of pain management. They should be applied after an adequate diagnosis is made, after psychiatric characterization of the entire pain problem is complete, and only when there is only a definitive pain generator which can be relieved by an interventional procedure. Perhaps the most important message we have heard is the categorization of pain patients given us by Doctor Hendler. It is important that we all identify those patients with affective or exaggerated pain behavior so that interventional procedures are carried out only on those patients who have a real possibility of benefiting from them. I believe if we all do this, we will see a significant increase in the effectiveness of surgical procedures for pain.', '[The choice of approach in the surgical therapy of the superior thoracic outlet syndrome].

Employing immunoelectron and immunofluorescence microscopy on yeast cells, we found that the binding of a polyspecific monoclonal antibody recognizing this family was predominantly at the nuclear pore complexes. Furthermore, the tagging of NUP49 with a unique epitope enabled the immunolocalization of this protein to the nuclear pore complex by both fluorescence and electron microscopy.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent calcium ion uptake was measured kinetically by the absorbence changes of murexide, a metallochromic indicator of ionized Ca++ concentrations, in the absence of oxalate or other calcium-complexing anions. In these experiments, time resolution of the Ca++ transport rate was limited by the manual mixing of reagents, which occurred in 1 to 3 seconds.

In SR from normal human muscle the ATP-dependent Ca++ uptake was 3.5 nmoles per second per milligram of protein for the first 5 seconds after ATP mixing. Fast kinetic experiments showed that Ca++ uptake proceeded linearly for the first 500 msec at a rate of 9 nmoles per second per milligram of protein (at 25 degrees C) and then progressively declined to reach steady-state levels in 40 to 50 seconds.

The demonstration of this Ca2+-induced release of Ca2+ relied entirely on experiments in which the tension developed by the myofilaments was used as a sensor of the changes of myoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([free Ca2+]) in segments of single cardiac cells from which the sarcolemma had been removed by microdissection (skinned cardiac cells). The small size of these preparations has previously prevented the use of more direct methods for the detection of myoplasmic Ca2+ movements. The present study is a direct demonstration of Ca2+-induced release of Ca2+ from the SR of skinned cardiac cells treated with chlorotetracycline (CTC), a fluorescent chelate probe which enables changes in the amount of Ca2+ bound to a variety of biological membranes or micelles to be monitored.

Single-cell suspensions prepared by enzymatic disaggregation of an immunogenic 3-methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma (Mc40A) contain a significant proportion of infiltrating leucocytes (approximately 42%), comprising T lymphocytes, macrophages and non-phagocytic FcR+ lymphoid-like cells. Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were isolated and purified by successive passage over Sephadex G-10 columns and their cytotoxic activity in vitro compared with that of lymphoid cells from normal rats and from tumour-bearers at different times after implantation. For this purpose, surviving target cells were quantified by incorporation of the gamma-emitting analogue of methionine, 75Sel-methionine, in a 48-h assay which detected both cytotoxic and cytostatic effects. The reactivity of TIL, which was consistently demonstrable from 11 days after tumour transplantation, was essentially similar to that of normal splenic lymphocytes in magnitude and specificity. Reciprocal cytotoxicity tests using TIL and cultured targets from an antigenically unrelated tumour of similar aetiology (Mc57) showed that the manifestation of TIL cytotoxicity was determined, not by the tumour of origin, but by the susceptibility of the target cells. Evidence that the effector function of TIL was mediated in part by natural killer (NK) cells was derived from concurrent experiments using human myeloid cells (K562) as targets in an 18h 51Cr-release assay. In this system the level of NK activity was critically dependent on the numbers of tumour cells in the TIL population; contamination in excess of 2% gave rise to dose-dependent inhibition of NK function. The results show that within a progressively growing tumour known to possess rejection antigens, NK reactivity was detected in the absence of a demonstrable tumour-specific cytotoxic component.', 'Naturally occurring lymphocyte-mediated immunity to endogenous type-C virus in the mouse. Blocking of the lymphocyte reactivity with antisera to the virus. The natural immune response in mice to their endogenous type-C viruses involves a complex interaction between cellular and humoral immune mechanisms. The virus-specific immune reactivities are a function of age and appear only subsequent to endogenous virus expression. Cellular immune activity was found to reside in a population of lymphocytes that were characterized as natural killer cells based on their absence of theta surface antigens or immunoglobulin or complement receptors. Cellular and humoral virus-specific immune responses co-occur in the same animal and pretreatment of virus-positive target cells with sera from virus-positive aging mice is capable of partially blocking the cytotoxic activity of reactive lymphocytes. The blocking activity of sera from individual mice increases as a function of age and endogenous virus expression and is highly correlated with the virus-specific complement-dependent cytotoxic activity of these sera. Mouse sera, whether naturally immune or immune as a result of hyperimmunization with type-C virus, exhibit blocking activity that can be removed by absorption with purified type-C virus or purified viral glycoprotein (gp 70) but not by absorption with noninfected syngeneic cells. High-titered and highly specific antisera directed against certain individual R-MuLV structural proteins reveal blocking activity. Monospecific antisera to gp 70 and p 12 exhibited high-titered blocking reactivities which are absorbable by the respective purified proteins. Blocking activity of antisera directed against other viral structural proteins could not be excluded with certainty. These findings raise the possibility that immunity in the mouse to endogenous type-C virus or virus-infected cells involves competition between serum-blocking activity and natural-killer cell activity and further provides a unique model system for studying the mechanism of action of blocking antisera known to have monospecific reactivity against defined and purifiable transplantation antigens.']\n",

Since the advent of gene knockout technology in mice (see Appendix I, Section A-35), many genes encoding immune system proteins have been experimentally disrupted. Several strains of mice that have been generated show signs of autoimmunity, including autoantibodies and infiltration of organs by T cells. The study of these mice has expanded our knowledge of the pathways that contribute to autoimmunity, and therefore their induced mutations might be candidates for identifying naturally occurring mutations. These mutations likely affect genes that encode cytokines, co-receptors, molecules involved in antigen-signaling cascades, co-stimulatory molecules, proteins involved in apoptosis, and proteins that clear antigen or antigen:antibody complexes. A number of cytokines and signaling proteins implicated in autoimmune disease are listed in Fig. 15.32.

Construction of transgenic mice is predicated upon inserting foreign DNA into native host DNA and having this expressed in the germline. This may be accomplished by nuclear injection, retroviral vectors or use of embryonic stem (ES) cells. 2. Expression of novel structural genes may be reasonably directed by the judicious use of an accompanying promoter/enhancer sequence. Insertion of foreign genes may be designed to result in phenotypic expression of a novel trait or ablation of a native gene or gene product. 3. Resulting transgenic mice offer significant utility as models of human diseases and a unique opportunity for investigating immune and metabolic pathways as well as for exploring mechanisms of development, mutagenesis and teratogenesis. 4. Use of transgenic animals in drug development has considerable potential although realization of this potential will take time. Constructing transgenics is only the first step in a complex series of events culminating in understanding the consequences of imposing novel genetic material on an intact, highly integrated living system.

Transgenic mice have been particularly useful in studying the role of T-cell and B-cell receptors in lymphocyte development, as described in Chapter 8, and in providing a source of primary T and B lymphocytes of known antigen specificity for adoptive transfer studies (see Section A-31). This utility is largely due to the fact that expression of the transgene-encoded T-cell and B-cell receptors preempts the rearrangement and expression of the endogenous antigen receptor genes during T-cell and B-cell development, respectively, thereby generating homogeneous populations of cells bearing a unique antigen receptor of known specificity.']\n",

In one such preparation, the electromyographic signals from the flexors and extensors of a limb were recorded, and the FRA fibers then stimulated to demonstrate the effect on locomotion rhythm ( Fig. 9.10 ).

Implications of this new data for pediatric nursing practice will also be examined.', '[Significance of sleeping position on the occurrence of sudden, unexplained infant death. An epidemiological review]. The cause of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is, according to the definition, unknown. Epidemiological research during recent years has identified a series of probable risk factors. One of these is the use of prone position as sleeping position. In the Western European countries, Australia and New Zealand, a total of 14 case-control studies illustrate a possible connection between the prone position and SIDS. Eleven of the studies revealed a significantly increased relative risk (RR) of between 1.4 and 12.5 for SIDS when using the prone position, while the three remaining studies did not demonstrate increased RR. A meta-analysis of the results of the 14 case-control studies showed an RR of 2.4 for SIDS in the prone position as compared with other sleeping positions. In a single prospective cohort study from Australia, an RR of 3.1 was found for SIDS in the prone position. Interventions in which parents are advised not to place the infants in the prone position during sleep appear to have resulted in considerable reduction in the number of cases of SIDS according to preliminary reports from Great Britain, the Netherlands, Norway and New Zealand. A series of methodological problems can be demonstrated in the published results of these studies, including limited size of study populations, inadequate matching of control groups and absent confounder control. Nevertheless, the total epidemiological evidence, also where Denmark is concerned, speaks in favour of altered recommendations for sleeping positions of infants, particularly because there is no documentation to suggest that the prone position offers any advantages to health.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)']\n",

      "retrieved contexts: ['Urokinase expression in mononuclear phagocytes: cytokine-specific modulation by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This study delineates the regulatory effects of inflammatory cytokines on mononuclear phagocyte plasminogen activator (PA) activity. The mechanisms by which mononuclear phagocytes modulate PA activity are described. Mononuclear phagocytes regulate net PA activity by the balanced expression of urokinase-type PA (uPA), in either secreted or membrane-associated forms, and a specific plasminogen activator inhibitor, PAI-2. Therefore, understanding how immunomodulators regulate macrophage PA activity requires that the comparative effects of uPA and PAI-2 be elucidated. We determine how recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) regulate plasminogen activation in monoblast-like U937 cells and normal human monocytes. In U937 cells, both IFN and TNF induced concurrent increases in secreted PA and PA inhibitor activities. These effects were accompanied by increased immunoreactive uPA and PAI-2 in conditioned media (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and steady-state levels of cellular uPA and PAI-2 mRNA (Northern analysis). To determine the relative abilities of IFN and TNF to either promote or inhibit plasmin generation, we directly compared the effects IFN and TNF, using optimal stimulating concentrations. IFN induced PA activity to 180% of the level achieved by TNF. In contrast, IFN elicited only 78% of the PA inhibitor produced by TNF stimulation. These differences in secreted activity can be explained by the shift in balance between uPA and PAI-2 proteins. Immunoreactive uPA was induced equally by IFN and TNF, but TNF generated higher levels of PAI-2. The same overall pattern of results was seen in normal human monocytes. IFN and TNF differ greatly in the ability to augment receptor-bound PA activity in U937 cells, as IFN induced a twofold increase but TNF had no effect. We conclude that IFN and TNF modulate mononuclear phagocyte proteolytic activity through coordinate regulation of secreted and receptor-bound uPA, balanced against concurrent expression of PAI-2. These effects are cytokine specific, as IFN is superior to TNF in stimulating expression of both secreted and receptor-associated PA activities. These properties suggest mechanisms by which mononuclear phagocytes control proteolysis in cytokine-rich inflammatory foci.', 'Enhancement of polymorphonuclear cell phagocytosis by lipid A-activated monocytes via cell-to-cell contact. A possible role for membrane-associated cytokines. Previous findings have shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated human monocytes express cytokines (CKs) on their membrane. Furthermore, those associated to membrane products such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 have been demonstrated to exert many biological activities. In this paper, evidence is provided that human polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) exhibited an increased phagocytic capacity following incubation with either lipid A (LA)-activated autologous monocytes or supernatants recovered from LA-stimulated mononuclear cell cultures. In order to investigate the possible role of monocyte membrane-associated TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta in the modulation of PMN activity, in a separate series of experiments LA-activated monocytes or LA-activated supernatants were pretreated with anti-recombinant human (Rhu) TNF alpha, anti-Rhu IL-1 alpha and anti-Rhu IL-1 beta monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), respectively. Such an approach gave rise to an abrogation of monocyte-mediated triggering effect on PMN functional capacity. Taken together, these data suggest that activated monocytes can upregulate PMN phagocytosis by a cell-to-cell contact mechanism, likely related to membrane-associated CKs.']\n",

A considerable amount is known about Ig biosynthesis by mature plasma cells, which form large amounts of Ig for secretion from the cell. A brief summary is given of the formation of light (L) and heavy (H) chains by polyribosomes aligned on the endoplasmic reticulum and the rapid assembly of the chains into 7S molecules (H2L2) by disulphide bonding. There is a time-ordered secretion from the cell of 7S Ig molecules; the polymeric forms of Ig, ie, IgM and IgA, are formed from monomers by disulphide bond interchange and J chain incorporation at the time of secretion. Myeloma cells from mouse and man have proved very useful in this type of study but such malignant cells show many defects in regulatory mechanisms; therefore, no conclusions can be drawn about normal control mechanisms without analysis of lymphoid tissues from normal or immunized animals. The pattern of Ig synthesis by the mature cell contrasts with that by small B lymphocytes which form 1/50 to 1/100 the amount of Ig produced by mature cells. Most of the small lymphocyte Ig is associated with the cell surface, and in IgM-producing cells the surface receptors are 7S monomer subunits of IgM. Such receptors turn over slowly (24-48 hours); they may be gradually shed from the cell surface but the small lymphocyte does not actively secrete Ig. Antigen- and cell-cell interactions stimulate small B lymphocytes to divide and mature into Ig-secreting cells. Little is known about the associated intracellular events, but preliminary data on lipopolysaccaride-stimulated mouse spleen cells indicate that transcription of m-RNA for H-chain mirrors the kinetics of DNA synthesis.

In contrast, the blood-brain barrier in group IH was not restored in similar brain regions until 24 h postinjury. These studies demonstrate that (1) hypoxia after brain injury exacerbates the regional breakdown of the blood-brain barrier to circulating proteins, (2) this influence of hypoxia on permeability is not apparent immediately after injury but rather is expressed at 6 h after injury, and (3) hypoxia after traumatic brain injury delays recovery of the blood-brain barrier. These findings suggest that secondary posttraumatic hypoxia contributes to the vascular pathogenesis of brain injury.', \"The effect of age on motor and cognitive deficits after traumatic brain injury in rats. Age is one of the most important predictors of outcome after human traumatic brain injury. This study used fluid percussion brain injury to investigate the effects of aging on outcome after brain injury in rats. Three-month-old (n = 8) and 20-month-old (n = 11) rats were injured at a low level (1.7-1.8 atm) of fluid percussion brain injury or received a sham injury (n = 6 for both age groups). Body weight and motor function (beam balance and beam walking) were assessed before injury and for the first 5 days after injury. Cognitive outcome was assessed with the Morris water maze on Days 11 to 15 after injury. Injury did not produce significant weight loss in either age group. At the low level of brain injury used in this study, the 3-month-old rats did not demonstrate any significant motor deficits on the beam-balance or beam-walking tasks. However, the 20-month-old rats displayed significant beam-balance deficits on each of the 5 postinjury test days and significant beam-walking deficits for the first 3 postinjury days. Although Morris water maze performance was impaired in both age groups, the magnitude of impairment was greater in the aged animals. These data demonstrate that traumatic brain injury in the aged animal is marked by increased motor and cognitive deficits, in the absence of pronounced compromise of the animal's general health.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\"]\n",

Reasons for selecting breast or bottle feeding relate to demographic, socioeconomic, educational, ethnic, cultural, and psychological factors, as well as maternal and infant physical and emotional health.

Infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality rates were computed for number of prenatal visits, type of hospital of delivery, hospital vs. nonhospital delivery, and geographical access to health care. The mortality rates were twice as great for infants born outside of hospitals. With no prenatal care, the infant mortality rates were between four- and tenfold greater than the rates of women receiving more than nine visits even when race, poverty, geography, and birth weight were considered. Infant mortality rates were twice as high in the neonatal period and three times greater in the postneonatal period among the poor who utilized charity hospitals.

Patients with diabetic nephropathy suffer high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Because only 40% of diabetic patients eventually develop diabetic kidney disease, it may be possible to devise primary prevention measures targeted at the subset of patients at risk. Recently, a predisposition to hypertension, a family history of diabetic nephropathy, and a family history of CVD disease each have been associated independently with the development of diabetic renal complication in IDDM. Risk factors for macrovascular damage, including raised arterial BP, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, can be detected early in the course of progression to diabetic nephropathy. These risk indicators recently have been shown to be already present at the stage of normoalbuminuria in those patients who eventually will progress to microalbuminuria. Treatment of established renal disease can only delay the onset of ESRF, and lowering of microalbuminuria has been shown to retard the onset of persistent proteinuria. However, no study to date has demonstrated prevention of renal disease in these patients.

The pulsatile pattern of GH-release by the anterior pituitary is regulated by the interaction of stimulating and inhibiting hormones and influenced by physiological and pharmacological factors. GH promotes longitudinal bone growth mainly through activation of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), but there may also be a direct effect. The most important clinical feature of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a low growth velocity resulting in short stature. In addition to retardation of bone maturation many GH-deficient children exhibit a number of typical, clinical characteristics. The diagnosis GHD can be confirmed by performing GH-stimulation tests and IGF-I measurements. However, the maximal GH-response to provocative stimuli is a poor indicator of the spontaneous GH-secretion. Classifications and etiology of GHD are given. Since 1958 GH-deficient children are treated with human GH with initially disappointing results regarding attained final height. Early diagnosis and treatment and optimization of GH-dose, mode of administration and injection frequency might improve final height. In The Netherlands the currently used GH-dose is 12-14 IU/m2/week in 6 or 7 daily doses administered subcutaneously. Ongoing retrospective and prospective studies serve to determine optimal treatment schedules.

One of the important aims of growth hormone (GH) treatment in GH deficient children is to allow them to grow to their full genetic potential. Usually, however, the final height of GH deficient children does not reach normal adult height and is below their target height. Furthermore, isolated GHD with spontaneous puberty is known to lead to a shorter adult height than that obtained in GHD associated with gonadotropin deficiency. The height at the start of puberty is reported to be well correlated with final height in GHD. Therefore, when isolated GHD subjects treated with GH reached puberty while they were still shorter than normal, they ended up by being shorter than normal as adults. The trial to increase the GH dose during puberty did not seem to increase the final height. The gonadal suppression therapy combined with GH treatment significantly increased the final height in isolated GHD. It is now the consensus that insufficient height at the onset of puberty leads to short final height and that early diagnosis of GHD is thus important to allow catch-up growth to optimal height before puberty. It may also be beneficial to treat GHD with higher doses to overcome the waning phenomenon with GH treatment.']\n",

Ten patients had conversion disorder, six borderline or mixed personality disorder and four mental retardation. Fifteen had had some precipitating stressor and the remainder had histories of exhibiting attention-seeking behaviour. Nine of 10 patients with conversion disorder had 'conversion V' Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profiles, while personality disorder patients had elevation of several psychopathological scales. Patients with conversion disorder gradually improved with anticonvulsant discontinuation, while retarded individuals were helped by behaviour modification, situational change or neuroleptics. Personality disorder patients continued to have attacks and eventually discontinued follow-up.

In contrast, tumors derived from biochemically differentiated clonal cell lines retained their morphologic and biochemical characteristics to a much greater extent, even after prolonged periods of sc transplantation.\", 'Concepts for treatment of micrometastases developed in murine systems. Small tumor cell foci, whether left in situ during primary surgical excision or escaping lethal radiation damage, as well as distant metastases, are the primary reason for treatment failure in man and are the proper targets for the chemotherapist and immunotherapist. Since cure probably requires reduction of the total body burden of tumor cells to very small numbers (possibly to less than one cell), and since first-order kinetics of tumor cell kill by drugs appears to be a natural law in cancer chemotherapy, drug treatment should be started as soon as possible after likely noncurative primary treatment with surgery or radiation. Current knowledge of tumor cell population growth kinetics indicates that the growth fraction (viable tumor cells undergoing active cell replication) is inversely related to population size. Tumor cells in micrometastases should, therefore, be more sensitive to anticancer drugs active against anabolizing cells than are tumor cells in the larger, grossly apparent primary tumor from which they were derived. This indicates the probability that micrometastases will be effectively responsive to more drugs than is the primary and clinically apparent tumor from which they came. Studies with at least four metastatic and uniformly fatal murine solid tumors (lung, breast, colon, and melanoma) have demonstrated significantly improved cure rates with drug treatment following surgical removal of the grossly apparent primary tumor than can be obtained with either surgery or drug treatment when used alone. Further, both disease staging and drug dosage have been shown to influence cure rates of combined-modality treatment. With several mouse tumors, a significantly smaller number of viable tumor cells can establish lethal tumors in the presence of radiation-inactivated tumor cells than in their absence. This suggests that small numbers of residual viable tumor cells in radiation-treated tumor sites may be a greater threat to clinical cure than smaller tumor cell populations remaining in situ after surgery.']\n",

Empirical medicine has three main supporting pillars: physical treatment, dietetics and phytotherapy. In this area of medicine, a number of therapeutical methods have been evolved which stand up to investigations employing scientific criteria, and which, in consequence, have become officially recognized by medical science. Examples are: diet rich in bulkage, digitalis, products of Papaver somniferum (Poppy) and salicylates. The acceptance of phytotherapeutic agents into the drug armamentarium of scientific medicine presupposes the availability of test methods suitable to demonstrate their effectiveness. Quite a number of remedies that have always been firmly anchored in empirical medicine, but which was applied regularly only by the nature healer, have suddenly, in the light of new test methods, been shown to be effective medicines; thus, for example, onions and garlic are good for thrombotic processes and hyperglycaemia, carminatives for sphincter spasms in the gastrointestinal tract, and alcohol is an appetite-stimulating stomachic. This fact, the limited applicability of the information obtained from animal experiments, and the further fact that even test results obtained in human subjects cannot be applied on a world-wide basis, exhort us to take care not to subscribe to an all-too apodictic classification of therapeutic measures into effective and noneffective.

Some global results are presented here several studies of psychosociology conducted in Lorraine; they deal with attitudes and expectations of the people about their health and are obtained from a special factor analysis. This method, of a descriptive nature, allows us to understand the pluridimensional universe of some of the representations considered and particularly to determine how each representation is connected with the others and how they are assembled within the whole system so as to establish typologies. The observation is made, notably by means of 2 projections on situational maps, that axis 1 establishes a bi-polarity among the wider tendencies such as medecine, physicians, health which corresponds, roughly speaking, to an opposition between \\\\\"some collar\\\\\" workers and \\\\\"white collar\\\\\" cadres, fatalists and non-fatalists. Less clearly appears a double splitting within the group of cadres and whtin the group of workers, the latter being less favored in the field of medicine and health. We can thus perceive 4 sectors where constellations of variables are organized and which correspond to typologies of attitudes. In fact, whether we rely on socio-professional stratifications or on mentalities, we must, to be efficient, take into account associations of attitudes as well as expectations, constructed according to this method, before starting selective actions of health education.', 'A descriptive analysis of articles in the journal of Social and Preventive Medicine (Soz Pr\\\\u00e4ventivmed): 1980-1990. This study provides a descriptive image of the work published in Soz Pr\\\\u00e4ventivmed between 1980 and 1990, and analyses certain trends. All articles of this period were categorized and recorded in a data base for: language of publication, city of location and affiliation of first author, sponsor (funding body), citation in Medline, regions and population concerned, type of article and subject matter. Over the decade, we note a reduction in the number of articles with a corresponding increase in their page length, and a progressive increase in the number of articles in English when compared with the two principal languages, German (1/2) and French (1/3). A majority of authors have university affiliations. Studies with original results comprise on average 44.6% of all publications, a tendency which gradually decreases over time. The proportion of epidemiological studies, a majority of which are descriptive studies, has increased progressively since 1980.

      "retrieved contexts: [\"[Folk medicine, experience therapy, a component of modern therapeutics?]. Empirical medicine has three main supporting pillars: physical treatment, dietetics and phytotherapy. In this area of medicine, a number of therapeutical methods have been evolved which stand up to investigations employing scientific criteria, and which, in consequence, have become officially recognized by medical science. Examples are: diet rich in bulkage, digitalis, products of Papaver somniferum (Poppy) and salicylates. The acceptance of phytotherapeutic agents into the drug armamentarium of scientific medicine presupposes the availability of test methods suitable to demonstrate their effectiveness. Quite a number of remedies that have always been firmly anchored in empirical medicine, but which was applied regularly only by the nature healer, have suddenly, in the light of new test methods, been shown to be effective medicines; thus, for example, onions and garlic are good for thrombotic processes and hyperglycaemia, carminatives for sphincter spasms in the gastrointestinal tract, and alcohol is an appetite-stimulating stomachic. This fact, the limited applicability of the information obtained from animal experiments, and the further fact that even test results obtained in human subjects cannot be applied on a world-wide basis, exhort us to take care not to subscribe to an all-too apodictic classification of therapeutic measures into effective and noneffective. A further point for consideration is that the administration even of what is only a supposed remedy, can trigger or promote healing simply on the strength of the action of the physician. Scientific thinking is an indispensible precondition of the physician's activity--to consider it as the beginning and end of all things medical, however, is simply to demonstrate a narrowness of outlook.\", 'InternalMed_Harrison.

The liver serves as the first site of processing for most absorbed nutrients and also secretes bile acids, which as we learned in , play a critical role in absorption of lipids from the diet. In addition the liver is a metabolic powerhouse, critical for disposing of a variety of metabolic waste products and xenobiotics from the body by converting them to forms that can be excreted. The liver stores or produces numerous substances needed by the body, such as glucose, amino acids, and plasma proteins. In general, key functions of the liver can be divided into three areas: (1) contributions to whole-body metabolism, (2) detoxification, and (3) excretion of protein-bound/lipid-soluble waste products. In this chapter we discuss the structural and molecular features of the liver and biliary system that subserve these functions, as well as', 'Function of the human colon.

All these methods have limitations and results must be interpreted with caution.

Recent research has demonstrated its importance as a metabolic organ with an influence on overall metabolism, an effect that may in large part be attributed to the activity of colonic microflora.

The procedure for anticonvulsant analysis represent use of a relatively new technology. The procedures compare favorably in accuracy and precision with accepted methodology using gas chromatography [14]. It is possible to determine a greater number of anticonvulsants simultaneously with liquid chromatography than with reported gas-chromatographic procedures. This is because gas chromatography necessitates manipulation of the sample to be analyzed, the various components of which may have completely different manipulation requirements. Liquid chromatography is able to effect the analysis without extensive manipulation of the sample. The columns recommended in Sect. III are currently available standard columns. Column technology is developing at an accelerating rate. It is now anticipated that new developments in microparticulate packings and improvements in packing techniques will give the analyst greater column efficiency. This may be used either to shorten overall analysis time or to include more drugs in a simultaneous analysis. There is not yet available to the analyst a variety of different detectors suitable for routine use. This situation will change. In the case of the successful use of ultraviolet spectrophotometric detectors, the technique is not being fully exploited. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry is firmly established in practice, but as yet it is not routine to apply dual-wavelength spectroscopy to the column effluent. Application of this technique may be expected to improve selectivity and quantitation besides permitting optical resolution of some components that are not separated by the column. In the procedures given in this chapter there was no detailed discussion on gradient elution. This technique is potentially of great utility for simultaneous analyses of many compounds. It should be used only where isocratic elution is out of the question because it calls for somewhat stricter requirements of equipment in control of chromatography conditions. An additional time for equilibration between analyses may be considered too high a price to pay for any advantage gradient elution may give the analyst. The problem of fully automatic operation of liquid chromatographs for the type of analysis discussed here remains to be solved. Automatic operation would advance the use of liquid chromatography in the clinical laboratory probably more than any other single improvement. However, regardless of refinements of this type, liquid chromatography in its modern manifestation has versatility and sensitivity in abundance for analyzing compounds of toxicological and clinical interest. It will therefore assume greater importance in these areas.', 'Dimensions of knowledge sharing and reuse.

Knowledge reuse involves many dimensions, including the reapplication of lexicons, ontologies, inference syntax, tasks, and problem-solving methods.

Progress in the area of knowledge sharing will necessitate more practical experience with attempts to interchange knowledge as well as better tools for viewing and editing knowledge representations at appropriate levels of abstraction.

The comparison, with the help of a check list of criteria, of psychotropic clinical trials published in France, with an interval of five years, covered 80 trials in 1970 and 75 trials in 1975. The differences found between these two years all indicate a stricter methodological approach in 1975. Certain gaps persist however, such as the extreme rarity of codified pretherapeutic evaluation, preliminary wash out periods, references to an official nosography and a sufficient homogeneity of treatment groups. On the other hand, in the majority of trials, the exclusion criteria are not given and a global clinical assessment is the only criterium of change used. Finally the conclusions proposed coincide with the data in only two thirds of the publications. The comparative revue of 120 controlled psychotropic trials so far published in French show above all the extreme variability of the type of control utilized. Only 58 trials out of 120 have been randomized and a minority of these were carried out according to a strict methodology, with quantitative evaluation of the results and an appropriate statistical analysis. The most frequent methodological insufficiences are the obvious heterogeneity of the treatment groups, the insufficient use of standardized evaluation instruments and the inadapted ness of certain experimental protocols to the goals being pursued. The points most frequently omitted in the presentation of the results are the drop-outs of treatment, information relating to associated and previous treatment, the dates of evaluation of the therapeutic effects as well as the approach used to established side effects. The recent application of the 1975 French Law has deeply changed the habits of French experimentators and it is necessary to correctly interpret the term of \\\\\"control\\\\\". The control of non-specific variables intervening in the therapeutical results is the only means of identifying the pharmacological effects of drugs. The best control of these variables is the randomized comparative trial of simultaneous treatment groups using double-blind prescriptions. In order to further comparisons of trials from different sources, it is absolutely necesary that evaluation studies in French be carried out and transmitted according to internationally recognized recommendations based on general rules of protocols and on standardized evaluation instruments.', 'A descriptive analysis of articles in the journal of Social and Preventive Medicine (Soz Pr\\\\u00e4ventivmed): 1980-1990.

Pulmonary scintigraphy using 99mTc-MAA clearly demonstrated a perfusion defect in the entire left lung of an 11-month-old girl with endobronchial foreign body.

Repeated pulmonary scintigraphy 24 hr after endoscopic removal of a peanut fragment from the left main stem bronchus demonstrated almost normal blood flow in the left lung. The well-known physiological explanation for diminished pulmonary blood flow due to endobronchial foreign bodies is as follows; alveolar hypoxia caused by hypoventilation due to bronchial check-valve obstruction leads to a pulmonary vasoconstriction with resultant diminution of the regional perfusion. Furthermore, the increase in alveolar pressure caused by bronchial check-valve obstruction may play a significant role in decreased pulmonary blood flow.', '[Spontaneous aortic dissection.

In therapeutic trials, quality of life studies are usually based on a health model which results in a restrictive view. Therefore, it is important to clearly define the concept of the quality of life, since ambiguous concepts can alter the results. The key to this problem is the clear distinction between the two components of the quality of life, ie subjective and objective. This latter component is the only one considered in the current medical approach. The use of the subjective quality of life introduces a number of methodological problems not found when the objective quality of life is assessed, and thus requires a specific model which can be derived from the model of life goals used by sociologists. This model is presented here and illustrated with some results obtained with a new questionnaire, the Subjective Quality of Life Profile (SQLP) questionnaire. We suggest that both subjective and objective quality of life studies should be considered in order to emphasize the humanistic approach to therapeutic indications.', '[Quality of life--demands and reality as a medical parameter versus quality of life as individual reality].

A new frame of reference, which in its fundamental structuring differs radically from the structuring of the familiar western Indo-European viewpoints (logical, mathematical, scientific, philosophical, etc.), already exists. Recently, by the strategem of systematically disallowing a previously unnoticed untenable assumption encoded in the traditional Western symbolic logics, set theories, etc., in particular and in the Western 'World-View' in general, this frame of reference has generated its own, entirely non-traditional, formalized language. The Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic has accepted for publication a first paper presenting this non-standard formalized language (Hilgartner, 1975). As one of its accomplishments, this new frame of reference delivers a general theory of living. This theory purports to span the entire domain of what we call living systems, human or non-human. The author did not originally devise this new frame of reference to account for the observable 'doings' of one-celled organisms. Consequently, any effort to illustrate the generalizations of this already-existing abstract theory in terms of humanly observable bacterial behavior has the effect of experimentally testing these generalizations. In the second portion of this paper, the author shows that the new viewpoint neatly accounts, with no 'loose ends,' for the published observations concerning the sensing of chemicals by bacteria; and also proposes two new experiments. Meanwhile, there exists a special dilemma which arises whenever its adepts attempt to discuss this non-standard frame of reference with persons versed in the standard Western one. By delineating the structuring of this dilemma, in the context of a human studying the sensing of chemicals by bacteria, the author demonstrates that the untenable assumption mentioned above does underlie the traditional Western viewpoints; and this demonstration suffices to show the traditional Western 'World-View' as fundamentally flawed.\", \"The psychosomatic key as a core approach to the modern plagues of mankind.

The latter symbol, meaning 'the variation of psi tone induced by a stimulus-event', belongs to a highly predictive system of quantitative psychosomatics, which enables--through a logico-mathematical tool--the ascertaining of personal levels of delta psi. Since a chronic exceeding of its tolerance threshold seems to give rise to the whole set of psychosomatic diseases, cancer perhaps included, it is suggested that the said system may help in diagnostically clearing the matter, perhaps also in controlling it.\"]\n",

In 1488 cases of chronic liver disease thrombocyte content of peripheral blood, clinical diagnosis and histologic findings of the liver biopsy were correlated. Ranging from fatty infiltration to fatty cirrhosis or from slightly active chronic hepatitis to active postnecrotic cirrhosis, according to the extent of the liver injury a significant decrease of thrombocyte-count was evaluated. In case of non-active liver disease and posthepatitic status a thrombocytopenia also could be found. Cirrhotic transformation or proliferation of the connective tissue mainly in the periportal fields and inflammatory activity showed a significant correlation to the frequency of a thrombocyte decrease. A pathogenetic relation is ascribed to an increased thrombocyte storage in the spleen depending on the extent of the liver injury and the alteration of the portal blood stream up to a portal hypertension. Our results indicate such correlations of liver injury, portal pressure and platelet-pooling to thrombocyte-count even if the causal dependency cannot be proved.', \"Clinical pathologic correlation in viral hepatitis.

Automated blood cell differentials using statistical classification techniques have been implemented in several commercial machines. The machine-derived features used to classify leukocytes resemble the descriptors used by humans performing visual classification, e.g. size, content, shape, color, and texture. However, because of our crude modeling of vision there is no universally accepted measure of characteristics such as shape, color, or texture. One expects, therefore, that features which are powerful discriminators for humans may perform poorly when quantified by machine, while other parameters may be more precisely measured automatically and so prove more useful in cell classification. This paper reports the results of a feature evaluation study for automated discrimination between all pairs of a large set of leukocyte classes consisting of both normal and abnormal types. To provide a framework for comparing automated feature ordering with the ranking attached by medical technologists, the machine-derived features were divided into six groups: size and content, mean and mode, cytoplasm/nucleus comparison, contrast and texture, color, and nuclear shape.

Examples are: diet rich in bulkage, digitalis, products of Papaver somniferum (Poppy) and salicylates. The acceptance of phytotherapeutic agents into the drug armamentarium of scientific medicine presupposes the availability of test methods suitable to demonstrate their effectiveness. Quite a number of remedies that have always been firmly anchored in empirical medicine, but which was applied regularly only by the nature healer, have suddenly, in the light of new test methods, been shown to be effective medicines; thus, for example, onions and garlic are good for thrombotic processes and hyperglycaemia, carminatives for sphincter spasms in the gastrointestinal tract, and alcohol is an appetite-stimulating stomachic.

Empirical medicine has three main supporting pillars: physical treatment, dietetics and phytotherapy. In this area of medicine, a number of therapeutical methods have been evolved which stand up to investigations employing scientific criteria, and which, in consequence, have become officially recognized by medical science. Examples are: diet rich in bulkage, digitalis, products of Papaver somniferum (Poppy) and salicylates. The acceptance of phytotherapeutic agents into the drug armamentarium of scientific medicine presupposes the availability of test methods suitable to demonstrate their effectiveness. Quite a number of remedies that have always been firmly anchored in empirical medicine, but which was applied regularly only by the nature healer, have suddenly, in the light of new test methods, been shown to be effective medicines; thus, for example, onions and garlic are good for thrombotic processes and hyperglycaemia, carminatives for sphincter spasms in the gastrointestinal tract, and alcohol is an appetite-stimulating stomachic. This fact, the limited applicability of the information obtained from animal experiments, and the further fact that even test results obtained in human subjects cannot be applied on a world-wide basis, exhort us to take care not to subscribe to an all-too apodictic classification of therapeutic measures into effective and noneffective. A further point for consideration is that the administration even of what is only a supposed remedy, can trigger or promote healing simply on the strength of the action of the physician. Scientific thinking is an indispensible precondition of the physician's activity--to consider it as the beginning and end of all things medical, however, is simply to demonstrate a narrowness of outlook.\", 'InternalMed_Harrison.

An extensive list of acute and chronic diseases of the liver that are treatable by a liver transplant is provided in Table 11-6.Offering transplants to alcoholic patients has always drawn some opposition because of the perception of it being a self-inflicted illness, as well as concerns about recidivism and the recipient\\\\u2019s possible inability to maintain postoperative immunosuppression and care.

Since the establishment of the scientific LTR, the frequency of OLTX has been increasing. Between 1988 and 1991, the number of procedures performed on pediatric patients increased by 28.2%, and among adult patients OLTX increased 84.8%. During this same period, the number of transplant centers performing OLTX rose 62.5% for children, and 54.7% for adult recipients. In 1991 there was a larger proportion of recipients under 1 year of age than in previous years. The effect was to lower the median age at transplantation from over 2 to between 1 and 2. In pediatric recipients of initial transplantation in 1991, compared with earlier recipients, the functional status at time of liver transplantation was improved. Fewer children were in the ICU while awaiting transplantation, and more were able to wait at home. Multiorgan transplantations in pediatric patients remained relatively rare, but a larger portion of these procedures in 1991 than was seen previously included the small intestine. Biliary atresia remained the most common indication for liver transplantation among children, accounting for over 55% of all OLTX procedures in 1991. There was a significant change in the racial distribution among adult recipients. Compared with previous years, there were greater proportions of Hispanic and Asian recipients in 1991. Adult recipients were older in 1991 than previously, and the median age increased from 46 to 49. As with pediatric recipients, adult recipients had better functional status in 1991 than earlier recipients. The increase in positive CMV serology was likely to be a function of older age. Among multiorgan recipients, the combination of liver and pancreas only was much less common in 1991 than previously. As was found previously (1), alcoholic cirrhosis continued to be the most common reason for OLTX, with the proportion of patients diagnosed with this condition increasing in 1991. Twice as many patients with cystic fibrosis were recipients in 1991 as in the prior 3 years. There were decreases in the proportion of patients receiving OLTX due to fulminant liver failure, metabolic disease, and malignant neoplasms. The cumulative probability of surviving (without retransplantation) 4 years after initial transplantation was 0.74 (0.61) for pediatric recipients. Univariate (unadjusted) analyses detected significant differences in survival for age (the youngest recipients had the worst survival), UNOS description (poorer functional status just prior to transplantation led to poorer survival), and primary liver disease (survival was worst for recipients transplanted due to fulminant liver failure, and best for patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)']\n",

During early stages of normal chick limb development, the homeobox-containing (HOX) gene GHox-4.6 is expressed throughout the posterior mesoderm of the wing bud from which most of the skeletal elements including the digits will develop, whereas GHox-8 is expressed in the anterior limb bud mesoderm which will not give rise to skeletal elements. In the present study, we have examined the expression of GHox-4.6 and GHox-8 in the wing buds of two polydactylous mutant chick embryos, diplopodia-5 and talpid2, from which supernumerary digits develop from anterior limb mesoderm, and have also examined the expression of these genes in response to polarizing zone grafts and retinoic acid-coated bead implants which induce the formation of supernumerary digits from anterior limb mesoderm. We have found that the formation of supernumerary digits from the anterior mesoderm in mutant and experimentally induced polydactylous limb buds is preceded by the ectopic expression of GHox-4.6 in the anterior mesoderm and the coincident suppression of GHox-8 expression in the anterior mesoderm.

Pertussis vaccines vary in quality, safety, and efficacy according to the production strains of Bordetella pertussis, the method of manufacture, and quality control procedures. It is therefore not justifiable to combine information on the incidence, nature, and severity of reactions after all manufacturers' pertussis vaccines as if they were a single product. Attempts were made to collect information on all suspected cases of severe reactions that occurred after administration of about 15 million doses of Wellcome pertussis vaccines in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland from 1964 to mid-1977. Altogether six deaths, six neurological reactions with sequelae, and 17 convulsions without sequelae were reported, but some were clearly not attributable to the vaccine, while, in other cases, the available information was inadequate for assessing the role of vaccination. Neurological disorders, similar to those reported in a few children after pertussis vaccination, occur unexpectedly in apparently healthy infants at the recommended age for immunisation, so chance association between vaccination and these events can be expected in some children. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has made several recommendations aimed at reducing severe reactions after pertussis vaccination. These include replacing plain vaccine with aluminium-adsorbed vaccine, but there is no clear evidence that the aluminium-adsorbed vaccine produces fewer reactions than the plain.There are difficulties enough in deciding the cause of events that occur after vaccination, since these reactions often occur naturally in children of vaccination age. The task is made even harder by the assumption that various manufacturers' vaccines are the same and the lack of information available to manufacturers about cases in which their vaccine has been implicated.

Patients with constipation are recommended to take dietary fiber positively, while those with diarrhea should consume sparingly food which may cool their body. Both should avoid overeating and overdrinking, and have regular dietary habits. In order to improve the functional disorder of the bowel, it is necessary for those patients (1) to be careful not to take often refined cereals or manufactured foods, (2) to eat green and yellow vegetables and seaweeds positively, as well as, protein and fat in proper quantity, and (3) to take care of the well-balanced intake of various kinds of vitamins, minerals and other nutriments.', 'Irritable bowel syndrome and dietary fiber. The effects of an increase in dietary fiber include: (a) More frequent stools, (b) more voluminous stools, (c) an alteration in the fecal flora, (d) an increase in fecal sterol excretion, and, it appears likely, (e) a reduction in intraluminal pressures in the sigmoid colon. Epidemiologic data comparing global differences in prevalence of certain diseases with the fiber content of diets suggest that there may be a relationship between the two. With a certain amount of post-ad hoc reasoning, it can be shown that some of the known effects of fiber could account for differences in disease prevalence between populations. The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome is so high that one is forced to concede the very real possibility that the environment, including the diet, may be responsible for symptoms that might not otherwise exist. It remains to be seen whether a marked increase in dietary fiber will prevent the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. It seems fairly certain that, given the preoccupation most of these individuals have with their bowel movements, the large bulky stools resulting from a high-fiber diet satisfy a very basic emotional need to \\\\\"have a good BM\\\\\" (meaning large), but whether this leads to better health remains to be proved.']\n",

The beneficial effects of dietary fiber on colonic physiology suggest that dietary fiber should be an effective treatment for IBS patients, but controlled trials of dietary fiber have produced variable results. This is not surprising since IBS is a heterogeneous disorder, with some patients being constipated and other having predominant diarrhea. Most investigations report increases in stool weight, decreases in colonic transit times, and improvement in constipation. Others have noted benefits in patients with alternating diarrhea and constipation, pain, and bloating. However, most studies observe no responses in patients with diarrheaor pain-predominant IBS. It is possible that different fiber preparations may have dissimilar effects on selected symptoms in IBS.

Sequential exoglycosidase analysis of individual oligosaccharides derived from each IgG-1 preparation was used to define these differences. Ascites-derived material differed from serum-free-culture-derived material only with respect to the content of sialic acid. IgG-1 derived from culture in serum-containing media had an intermediate sialic acid content and a lower incidence of outer-arm galactosylation than the other two preparations.

      "retrieved contexts: [\"Bacterial motility and chemotaxis. Bacteria swim using the only rotary motor identified in biology. The membrane bound motor uses the gradient of protons set up across the cytoplasmic membrane to drive the rotation of a semi-rigid protein helix, the flagellum. Free-swimming bacteria randomly change direction every few seconds, but if a gradient is encountered the direction-changing frequency can be biased to move the bacterium in a favourable direction. Bacteria respond to changes in chemical concentration, oxygen levels, pH, the intensity or wavelength of light, temperature and in some cases even the Earth's magnetic field and integrate the signals to move towards or maintain the cells in optimum conditions for growth and division. They also adapt to the changes, leaving them free to respond to any subsequent stimuli. Therefore bacteria have something akin to a primitive nervous system, with a sensory system which can respond and adapt to changes and integrate physical and chemical signals. Chemotaxis and motility are involved in infection, both positive (rhizobia) and negative (pathogens) and an understanding of the unique nature of motility and chemotaxis in bacteria may make it possible to control infection. This review will give a brief general overview of current knowledge of bacterial motility and chemotaxis but for more detailed analysis readers are referred to some more specific recent reviews.\", 'A response regulator model in a simple sensory system. Bacterial behavior is shown to be modulated through a simple on-off switching device which directs migration toward favorable conditions and away from unfavorable ones. The behavioral response is controlled by a rudimentary memory which allows the bacteria to sense gradients over time. The memory can be explained by a biochemical system involving a response regulator whose level relative to a threshold controls flagellar function. The level of the response regulator is itself controlled by factors such as enzyme levels and environmental stimuli. The molecular basis of the model appears to be relevant to more complex hormonal and neural signaling systems.']\n",

Experimental studies on the percutaneous absorption of hydro-cortisone fail to reveal a significant increase in absorption when applied on a repetitive basis and a single daily application may be effective in most conditions. Ointment bases tend to give better activity to the corticosteroid than do cream or lotion vehicles. Increasing the concentration of a corticosteroid increases the penetration but not proportionately. For example, approximately 1% of a 0.25% hydrocortisone solution is absorbed from the forearm. A tenfold increase in concentration causes only a fourfold increase in absorption. Solubility of the corticosteroid in the vehicle is a significant determinant of the percutaneous absorption of a topical steroid. Marked increases in efficacy are noted when optimized vehicles are used, as demonstrated by newer formulations of betamethasone dipropionate and diflorasone diacetate.', 'In vivo percutaneous absorption of hydrocortisone: multiple-application dosing in man.

Three serial doses of 13.33 micrograms/cm2 (total, 40 micrograms/cm2) were also expected to deliver 0.168 micrograms/cm2 with or without soap and water washing between doses, but the observed amount of hydrocortisone delivered through the skin significantly exceeded our expectations.

The results showed that 500 mg diflunisal produced comparable relief to aspirin within 3 to 4 hours, but the analgesic effect continued for longer and was still very marked after 8 hours. A multi-dose study in 120 patients receiving doses of diflunisal (375 mg or 500 mg) or placebo confirmed the overall effectiveness of twice daily treatment with diflunisal. In a comparative study against oxyphenbutazone (200 mg t.i.d.), hourly pain scores made on the first post-operative day showed that a single dose of 500 mg diflunisal produced comparable relief over a 12-hour period to that with 2 doses of 200 mg oxyphenbutazone.

Informed consent was obtained from all post-operative patients suffering from moderate to severe pain who participated in this study. Approximately 25 patients were included in each group. The data from 125 patients were subjected to statistical analysis. The results indicated that butorphanol is approximately 40 to 50 times more potent than meperidine. In addition, at most of the time intervals, there were no statistically significant differences between the responses to butorphanol 0.5 mg and 1 mg and meperidine 20 mg and 40 mg; but the response to butorphanol 2 mg was significantly (p less than 0.05) better than the low dose of each agent.

The larger doses (butorphanol 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg and meperidine 40 mg) appeared to produce a two- to four-hour duration of action. The largest butorphanol dose (2.0 mg) appeared to produce the longest duration of action. A comparison of the test groups with respect to the incidence and type of side effects showed that butorphanol 2.0 mg produced a greater incidence of drowsiness (39 per cent). The overall incidence of drowsiness for patients receiving either the 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg dose of butorphanol was 12 per cent, as compared with an 8 per cent overall incidence in the meperidine group. The incidence of other side effects was relatively low in all test groups. No significant differences were noted among the groups with regard to the onset (usually less than or equal to 30 minutes post-therapy) or the duration (usually less than or equal to 2 hours) of side effects.

Le(x) (alpha 1--&gt;3 fucosylated type 2 chain) functions as an adhesion molecule capable of Ca(2+)-mediated homotypic binding. Cells with high surface expression of Le(x) therefore exhibit strong self-aggregation (based on Le(x)-Le(x) interaction) in the presence of Ca2+. In this review, I have summarized several lines of supporting data for this concept, and the role of Le(x)-Le(x) interaction in the process of embryo compaction and autoaggregation of F9 teratocarcinoma cells. In general, cell adhesion events based on Le(x)-Le(x) interaction may be followed and reinforced by integrin- or Ig receptor-based adhesion systems. SLe(x), the 2--&gt;3 sialosyl derivative of Le(x), and its positional isomer SLe(a), have been identified as the target molecules for selectin-dependent cell adhesion. Adhesion of leukocytes or tumour cells to ECs or platelets, which express E-selectin and P-selectin respectively, is initiated by this process. The target epitopes SLe(x) and SLe(a) are presented mainly on transmembrane glycoproteins having many clusters of O-linked carbohydrate chains. Therefore, inhibition of O-glycosylation may be effective for blocking selectin-mediated cell adhesion. The abundant presence of Le(x) epitope in the central nervous system, and the physiological changes of Le(x) expression as described in this monograph, reflect the adhesive properties of this molecule and its sialyosylated and/or fucosylated derivatives.', 'Alpha 1 beta 1 integrin on neural crest cells recognizes some laminin substrata in a Ca(2+)-independent manner. Neural crest cells migrate along pathways containing laminin and other extracellular matrix molecules. In the present study, we functionally and biochemically identify an alpha 1 beta 1 integrin heterodimer which bears the HNK-1 epitope on neural crest cells. Using a quantitative cell adhesion assay, we find that this heterodimer mediates attachment to laminin substrata prepared in the presence of Ca2+. Interestingly, neural crest cells bind to laminin-Ca2+ substrata in the presence or absence of divalent cations in the cell attachment medium. In contrast, the attachment of neural crest cells to laminin substrata prepared in the presence of EDTA, heparin, Mg2+, or Mn2+ requires divalent cations. Interactions with these laminin substrata are mediated by a different integrin heterodimer, since antibodies against beta 1 but not alpha 1 integrins inhibit neural crest cell attachment. Thus, the type of laminin substratum appears to dictate the choice of laminin receptor used by neural crest cells. The laminin conformation is determined by the ratio of laminin to Ca2+, though incorporation of heparin during substratum polymerization alters the conformation even in the presence of Ca2+. Once polymerized, the substratum appears stable, not being altered by soaking in either EDTA or divalent cations. Our findings demonstrate: (a) that the alpha 1 beta 1 integrin can bind to some forms of laminin in the absence of soluble divalent cations; (b) that substratum preparation conditions alter the conformation of laminin such that plating laminin in the presence of Ca2+ and/or heparin modulates its configuration; and (c) that neural crest cells utilize different integrins to recognize different laminin conformations.']\n",

Models of the bone salt and its synthetic analogues have been strenuously, and sometimes emotionally debated since the late nineteenth century. The main protagonist in the drama is the ubiquitous CO3=ion whose role has never been clearly understood. Initially regarded as an essential part of the calcium phosphate crystal complex, it came to be dubiously designated as a separate phase CaCO3, as an adsorbed ion, or even as a mere contaminant. More recent studies provide evidence that the original impression may be more nearly correct. Of particular interest in defining the role of CO3= in bone are the reactions involved in the formation of CO3-apatite under conditions approximating the physiological. These observations suggest that the synthesis of bone mineral involves hydrolysis of an initial acidic calcium phosphate precipitate to octacalcium phosphate, which is then converted to octacalcium phosphate carbonate (OCPC) by virtue of the replacement of PO4 identical to (HPO4=) by CO3=. OCPC satisfies many criteria for a satisfactory definition of the nature of the bone mineral. It can explain its solubility behavior and the intrinsic relationship between PO4 identical to (HPO4=) and CO3=, the normal variations in bone composition, the sequence of events in bone mineral maturation, and the loss of CO3= under normal and pathological conditions.', '\\\\\"The chemistry of bone mineral\\\\\". In this treatise there has been a general introduction to the nature of bone mineral. Without the studies on the chemistry and structure of hydroxyapatites precipitated under physiological conditions it would have been difficult to interpret the data from bone mineral. Earlier studies on well-crystallized apatite systems helped to delineate the nature of the smaller bone crystals which are so difficult to study by standard crystallographic methods. It was shown that bone mineral is submicroscopic in crystal size and thus, has a high surface area which is highly reactive to specific chemical species. Bone mineral apatite is not an equilibrium phase and is slowly perfecting chemically and in crystal size. It is this lack of perfection resulting from crystalline imperfections due to (a) the presence of carbonate, sodium and other ions, and, (b) the deficiency in Ca and OH, which combine to make bone mineral metabolically active. In closing, it is necessary to point out that this is just a brief introduction to the subject of bone mineral. The interested reader is encouraged to seek more details in the bone text books of Vaughan (1975), Bourne (1972) and Zipkin (1973) and the various review articles noted in the body of this exposition.']\n",

When multiple roots are affected (polyradiculopathy) by an infiltrative, inflammatory, or compressive process, the syndrome is more complex and must be differentiated from polyneuropathy.

Viewed differently, the distribution of sensory and motor deficits defies the pattern expected of multiple single peripheral nerves and fails to display the length-dependent pattern of a generalized polyneuropathy.

Consequently, careful EMG and nerve conductions testing is the most useful ancillary examination in cases of complex neuropathic syndromes because the pattern of muscle denervation can be ascertained with greater certainty than by clinical means and a common root pattern can then be logically derived. Of great confirmatory value is the preservation of sensory potentials in nerves that innervate regions of sensory loss and supply weak and denervated muscles.

Most of the other CXC chemokines, including those that interact with receptors CXCR3, 4, and 5, lack this motif. Fractalkine is unusual in several respects: it has three amino acid residues between the two cysteines, and it exists in two forms, one that is tethered to the membrane of the endothelial and epithelial cells that express it, where it serves as an adhesion protein, and a soluble form that is released from the cell surface and acts as a chemoattractant for a wide range of cell types.

      "retrieved contexts: [\"Depression and Parkinson's disease: a review. The purpose of this review is to provide an update of the research regarding depression in Parkinson's disease and to synthesize the information into a neurobiological model relating the structural and biochemical changes in this disorder to the behavioral manifestations. The author used a computer-based search of the literature, augmented by extensive bibliography-guided article reviews, to find information on depression and Parkinson's disease. Depression occurs in approximately 40% of patients with Parkinson's disease; depression in Parkinson's disease is distinguished from other depressive disorders by greater anxiety and less self-punitive ideation. Lower CSF levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, a past history of depression, and greater functional disability are associated with a greater risk of depression in Parkinson's disease. Female gender, early age at onset of Parkinson's disease, and greater left brain involvement may also be risk factors. Approximately half of depressed patients with Parkinson's disease meet criteria for major depressive episodes; half have dysthymia. Depression is more common in Parkinson's disease with prominent bradykinesia and gait instability than in tremor-dominant syndromes. Depressed patients with Parkinson's disease have greater frontal lobe dysfunction and greater involvement of dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems than nondepressed patients with the disease. Mood changes in Parkinson's disease respond to treatment with conventional tricyclic antidepressants or ECT. Neurobiological investigations suggest that depression in Parkinson's disease may be mediated by dysfunction in mesocortical/prefrontal reward, motivational, and stress-response systems. Neuropsychological, metabolic, clinical, pharmacological, and anatomical studies support the involvement of frontal dopaminergic projections in patients with Parkinson's disease and depression.\", 'First_Aid_Step2.

Alglucerase (Ceredase) provides effective enzyme-replacement treatment for patients with Gaucher's disease, but at the usually recommended dose of 60 U per kilogram of body weight every two weeks (130 U per kilogram per month), it costs $382,200 per year for a 70-kg patient. Theoretical considerations suggest that more frequent administration would be more efficient. Fourteen patients with type 1 Gaucher's disease that was moderately severe to severe were given 30 U of alglucerase per kilogram per month, in divided doses given either daily or three times weekly, or 120 U given three times weekly. The effect of the treatment on the size of the liver and spleen and on blood counts was compared with published data on patients who received a total dose four to five times as large as the lower dose we used and who received treatment every two weeks. The response to 30 U of alglucerase per kilogram per month, fractionated into three or seven doses weekly, was approximately the same as that reported after the administration every two weeks of a dose four or five times as large, given in the large infusions usually recommended. A fourfold increase in the dose given three times weekly, from 2.3 to 9.2 U per kilogram, did not substantially increase the rate of improvement. The treatment of Gaucher's disease with smaller total doses of alglucerase given more frequently yields satisfactory results. A dose of 2.3 U per kilogram three times weekly yields major financial benefits with no sacrifice of therapeutic effect. Even taking into account the increased ancillary costs of more frequent administration, this method of administering alglucerase reduces the annual cost of the drug for a 70-kg patient to about $100,000.\", 'InternalMed_Harrison.
