      "retrieved contexts: ['Cell_Biology_Alberts. Looking at CeLLs anD MoLeCULes in the eLeCtron MiCrosCope Light microscopy is limited in the fineness of detail that it can reveal. Microscopes using other types of radiation—in particular, electron microscopes—can resolve much smaller structures than is possible with visible light. This higher resolution comes at a cost: specimen preparation for electron microscopy is complex and it is harder to be sure that what we see in the image corresponds precisely to the original living structure. It is possible, however, to use very rapid freezing to preserve structures faithfully for electron microscopy. Digital image analysis can be used to reconstruct threedimensional objects by combining information either from many individual particles or from multiple tilted views of a single object. Together, these approaches extend the resolution and scope of electron microscopy to the point at which we can faithfully image the structures of individual macromolecules and the complexes they form.', 'Cell_Biology_Alberts.

A limit to the resolution of a light microscope was therefore set by the wavelength of visible light, which ranges from about 0.4 μm (for violet) to 0.7 μm (for deep red). In practical terms, bacteria and mitochondria, which are about 500 nm (0.5 μm) wide, are generally the smallest objects whose shape we can clearly discern in the light microscope; details smaller than this are obscured by effects resulting from the wavelike nature of light. To understand why this occurs, we must follow the behavior of a beam of light as it passes through the lenses of a microscope (Figure 9–3).']\n",

Therefore, new trials have started in asymptomatic individuals with mild AD, in asymptomatic autosomal dominant forms of AD, and in cognitively normal elderly who are amyloid positive with PET. Medications that modify tau phosphorylation and aggregation, including tau antibodies, are beginning to be studied as possible treatments for both AD and non-AD tau-related disorders including FTD and progressive supranuclear palsy. Several retrospective studies suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) may have a protective effect on dementia if used prior to the onset of disease but do not influence clinically symptomatic AD.

This first interaction between T and B cells not only provides important help to B cells, but also influences T-cell differentiation by signals provided by the B cell. Activated B cells express ICOSL, a member of the B7 family of co-stimulatory molecules and a ligand for ICOS (inducible co-stimulatory protein), which is expressed by T cells. This Tand B-cell interaction, provided by linked recognition, activates ICOS signaling in T cells and is important for the completion of TFH differentiation (see Section 7-21), leading to induction of the transcription factors Bcl-6 and c-Maf. These transcription factors are required for SAP production and the consequent sustained contact between B and TFH cells. 10-5 Activated B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasmablasts and plasma cells.', 'Immunology_Janeway. When TFH cells encounter an activating peptide presented by B cells, the TFH cells respond by expressing receptors and cytokines that in turn activate B cells. As mentioned above, the induced expression of CD40L on TFH cells activates CD40 on B cells to increase B-cell survival, and also induces B-cell expression of co-stimulatory molecules, especially those of the B7 family. Activated T cells also express CD30 ligand (CD30L), which binds to CD30 expressed on B cells and promotes B-cell activation. Mice lacking CD30 show reduced proliferation of activated B cells in lymphoid follicles and weaker secondary humoral responses than normal. TFH cells also secrete several cytokines that regulate B-cell proliferation and antibody production. Primary among these is IL-21, which is produced early in immune responses by TFH cells and which activates the transcription factor STAT3 in B cells to support proliferation and differentiation.

Unlike other CD28-family members, however, BTLA does not interact with B7 ligands but binds a member of the TNF receptor family; called the herpesvirus entry molecule (HVEM), this receptor is highly expressed on resting T cells and immature dendritic cells. When BTLA and HVEM are co-expressed on the same cell, BTLA utilizes a second mechanism that further inhibits lymphocyte activation. In this configuration, BLTA binds to HVEM and prevents HVEM from binding to alternative partners that would stimulate NFκB-dependent pro-survival signaling pathways downstream of HVEM. Alternatively, when BTLA and HVEM are expressed on different cells, the interaction of these two receptors functions to stimulate the positive pro-survival signal in the HVEM-expressing cell.']\n",

Clinical Effects of Spinal Cord Injury When the spinal cord is suddenly and severely impacted, three disorders of function are at once evident: (1) all voluntary movement in parts of the body below the lesion is immediately lost; (2) sensation from the lower parts of the body is abolished; and (3) reflex functions in segments of the isolated spinal cord are suspended. The last effect, termed spinal shock, involves tendon as well as autonomic reflexes. This state is of variable duration (1 to 6 weeks but sometimes far longer) and is so dramatic that Riddoch used it as a basis for dividing the clinical effects of spinal cord transection into two stages, that of spinal shock with areflexia followed by a stage of heightened reflex activity.', 'Neurology_Adams. Paralysis of both lower extremities may occur with diseases of the spinal cord, nerve roots, or, less often, the peripheral nerves. If the onset is acute, it may be difficult to distinguish spinal paralysis, which results in flaccidity and abolition of reflexes from spinal shock, from that due to peripheral nerve disease. In acute spinal cord diseases with involvement of corticospinal tracts, the paralysis or weakness affects all muscles below a given level; if the white matter is extensively damaged, sensory loss below a circumferential level on the trunk is conjoined (loss of pain and temperature sense because of spinothalamic tract damage, and loss of vibratory and position sense from posterior column involvement). Also in bilateral disease of the spinal cord, the bladder and bowel and their sphincters are usually affected.

The eicosanoids thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin have opposing actions causing vasoconstriction and vasodilation respectively. The ratio of these two eicosanoids is thus an important determinant of circulatory homeostasis. An increase in this ratio occurs in certain inflammatory conditions with dramatic consequences in organ perfusion. In spinal cord trauma, in addition to direct physical perturbation of the spinal cord, it is likely that further structural and functional loss occurs as a result of decreased tissue perfusion precipitated by an increase in the thromboxane/prostacyclin ratio. This study evaluated hemodynamics and organ perfusion, 3 h following 24 g-cm spinal cord trauma in the rat. The role of thromboxane was investigated with an inhibitor of thromboxane synthesis (Dazoxiben) and with a receptor antagonist (13-APT). Cardiac output and blood pressure were unaffected by Dazoxiben, 13-APT, or spinal cord trauma. Injury effected approximately a 40% decrease in spinal cord perfusion from 0.41 to 0.25 ml/min/g which was not improved by the thromboxane synthase inhibitor, Dazoxiben. 13-ATP completely abrogated the decline in spinal cord blood flow flowing injury. Perfusion of other selected organs demonstrated little change as a result of the spinal trauma. Brain flow remained constant at 0.78 ml/min/g brain.

For example, side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving digitalis, hypoglycemia in patients given insulin, or bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulants are more readily related to a specific drug than are symptoms such as fever or rash, which may be caused by many drugs or by other factors. Electronic listings of adverse drug reactions can be useful. However, exhaustive compilations often provide little sense of perspective in terms of frequency and seriousness, which can vary considerably among patients.', 'InternalMed_Harrison. Adverse reactions can be classified in two broad groups. One type results from exaggeration of an intended pharmacologic action of the drug, such as increased bleeding with anticoagulants or bone marrow suppression with antineoplastics. The second type of adverse reaction ensues from toxic effects unrelated to the intended pharmacologic actions.

In contrast, lipid molecules rapidly exchange places with their neighbors within a monolayer (~107 times per second). This gives rise to a rapid lateral diffusion, with a diffusion coefficient (D) of about 10–8 cm2/sec, which means that an average lipid molecule diffuses the length of a large bacterial cell (~2 μm) in about 1 second.
